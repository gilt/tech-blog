Now that winter is here and the cold is keeping us inside, I thought it would be good to dream of warm days and look back at a BackOffice team outing from October.

On what turned out to be an unseasonably warm and beautiful Monday, a bunch of us took the day off and hiked the [Breakneck Ridge Trail](https://www.nynjtc.org/hike/breakneck-ridge-trail). It's a 3.5-mile loop that climbs quickly (read: steep scrambling) to amazing views of the Hudson River Valley. It's accessible via Metro-North out of NYC, so it's a great target for a day trip from the City.

Here are some photos of the trip - can't wait for the next one.
