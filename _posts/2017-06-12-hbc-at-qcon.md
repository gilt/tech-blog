Heading to QCon? Don't miss these two sessions! If you can't make it, stay tuned here for slides and recordings from the conference.

## Removing Friction In the Developer Experience

If you follow this blog at all, you know that we talk a lot about how we work here. Whether it's out approach to [adopting new technology](http://tech.gilt.com/leadership/2017/02/06/slack-and-voluntary-adoption), the work of our [POps team](http://tech.gilt.com/culture/2017/05/18/pops-up-plant-shop) or our [team ingredients](https://www.slideshare.net/hhfleming/the-new-work-order-team-ingredients-and-role-blending) framework, we're not shy when it comes to our people and culture.

With that in mind, it only makes sense that [Ade Trenaman](https://twitter.com/adrian_trenaman), SVP Engineering at Hudson's Bay Company, will be part of the Developer Experience track at QCon New York in June. Titled ["Removing Friction In the Developer Experience"](https://qconnewyork.com/ny2017/presentation/fitter-happier-more-productive-removing-friction-developer-experience), Ade will highlight a number of the steps we've taken as an organisation to improve how we work. His session will cover:

* how we blend microservice / serverless architectures, continuous deployment, and cloud technology to make it easy to push code swiftly, safely and frequently and operate it reliably in production.
* the organisational tools like [team self-selection](http://tech.gilt.com/agile/2017/05/31/self-selection-hbc), team ingredients (see above), voluntary adoption and internal startups that allow us to decentralise and decouple high-performing teams.

## Survival of the Fittest - Streaming Architectures

Michael Hansen will also be at QCon this year. [Mike's talk](https://qconnewyork.com/ny2017/presentation/survival-fittest-streaming-architectures) will help guide the audience through a process to adopt the best streaming model for their needs (because there is no perfect solution). 

In his own words: "Frameworks come and go, ​so this talk is not about the “best” framework or platform to use, rather it’s about core principles that will stand the tests of streaming evolution."

His talk will also cover: 
* major potential pitfalls that you may stumble over on your path to streaming and how to avoid them
* the next evolutionary step in streaming at Hudson's Bay Company

Hope to see you there!
