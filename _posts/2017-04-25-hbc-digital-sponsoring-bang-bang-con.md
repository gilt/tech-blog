On May 6-7 one of the year's most unique tech events is taking place in NYC. [!!Con](http://bangbangcon.com) (pronounced "bang bang con") is two-days of ten-minute talks featuring a diverse array of [speakers and topics](http://bangbangcon.com/speakers.html). You won't find a lineup like this at your typical tech conference - punch cards, cyborgs, glowing mushrooms, queer feminist cyberpunk manifestos and airplane noise are just a few of the topics on the agenda.

Given the excitement around this conference, tickets went fast - *sold-out-in-minutes-fast* - but there will be videos and a live stream so the 200+ person waiting list and those unable to be in NYC next weekend will still be able to enjoy the talks. Stay tuned to [@bangbangcon](https://twitter.com/bangbangcon) on Twitter for more info. 

We're thrilled to be supporting this year's !!Con as an **AWESOME!** Sponsor. Be sure to say hi to one of our friendly engineers and snag some HBC Digital swag if you're there!
