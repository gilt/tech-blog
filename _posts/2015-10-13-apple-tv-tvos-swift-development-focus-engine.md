At the Apple product launch event in September, Gilt demonstrated its upcoming “Gilt on TV” app for the Apple TV. (If you missed the demo and would like to see it, [Apple has the video available on their website](http://www.apple.com/apple-events/september-2015/). Eddy Cue's introduction of Gilt begins at the 74:20 mark.)

Last night, at the [iOSoho meetup](http://www.meetup.com/iOSoho/events/221974097/), I presented some of the things our team learned while developing that application, such as:

- Similarities and differences with iOS development
- The tvOS interaction model: What is “focus” and how does it work?
- Interacting with the Focus Engine to set up your initial UI state
- How the Focus Engine sees your views onscreen, and how that affects navigation
- Using focus guides to make your UI easier to navigate
- Swift: Is it ready for full-scale app development?
