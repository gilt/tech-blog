## Gilt Tech Blog Moves to Github

In continuing the march towards a more open Gilt Tech, we've made the switch to Github Pages and Jekyll from Tumblr.

You can view the entirety of this blog's code and content here: **[https://github.com/gilt/tech-blog](https://github.com/gilt/tech-blog)**.

## Why We Did This

First and foremost: control. We've got control over the layout and design of the blog from top to bottom, without restriction and without any kind of a funky theming engine to wrestle with. We're really good at this kind of thing (we should be, after all) and we've ended up with a blog design that matches elements of [gilt.com](http://gilt.com).

We've also got better control over how we write posts. We're a fairly large, distributed organization, and coordinating the setup, permissions, et al for Tumblr was kind of a pain. There was also very little positive feedback about the authoring experience. With the move everyone is able to author in their editor of choice and go through the already familiar process of submitting the post to the tech-blog repository.

## We Used Technology

**[Jekyll Bootstrap](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/)** is a fantastic bootstrap/scaffolding package put together to quickly spin up a blog.
While we customized the bajeezus out of it, which was incredibly quick and painless, and rolled our own 'gilt' theme, we used a healthy
chunk of what it ships with by default. We did roll our own helpful tidbits, like the [authors page](http://tech.gilt.com/authors.html),
for which you can view the source [here](https://github.com/gilt/tech-blog/blob/gh-pages/authors.html).

**[Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/)**. If you haven't looked into Github Pages for simple hosted websites or project websites yet, give it a gander. It's a phenomenal way to quickly spin up a site, and it's Jekyll support is pretty great.

## Fin

We hope you like the new digs, and we're forecasting a lot more great content to come.
