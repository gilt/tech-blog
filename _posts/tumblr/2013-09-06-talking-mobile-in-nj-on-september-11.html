<p>If you didn&rsquo;t get to attend last night&rsquo;s standing-room-only Gilt mobile <a href="http://tech.gilt.com/2013/08/30/come-to-our-mobile-fireside-chat-on-9-5" target="_blank">fireside chat</a> at our Manhattan office, and live in northern New Jersey (or fancy a sojourn along the Hudson&rsquo;s western banks), head to Hoboken next Wednesday forÂ <a href="http://www.meetup.com/MobileDevNJ/" target="_blank">MobileDevNJ</a>&rsquo;s monthly meetup, featuring Gilt Senior Software Engineer Matt Isaacs. Matt will discuss mobile UI testing and automation and how these are performed at Gilt. He&rsquo;ll review some of the tools that Gilt has considered using and describe what the company uses now, and will describe one or two examples in greater detail. The talk will mostly focus on native UI testing with Appium.</p>
