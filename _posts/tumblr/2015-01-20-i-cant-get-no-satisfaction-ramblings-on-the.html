<p><span><em>This is part of a series of ramblings on the <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html" target="_blank">Principles behind the Agile Manifesto</a>, reposted with permission from<a href="https://incrementalme.wordpress.com/tag/agile/" target="_blank"> Incremental Me</a>.</em></span></p>
<p><span><em><strong>&ldquo;Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.&rdquo;</strong></em></span></p>
<p><span>In software development…</span></p>
<ul><li>In order to satisfy the customer you have to truly understand what the customer <em>needs</em>.
<ul><li>Sometimes what a customer wants is very different than what a customer needs.</li>
<li>Keep asking “Why? Why? Why?”</li>
<li>This requires the customer to be very much engaged in what is happening.  They need to be able to express whether or not they are satisfied in real-time.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Early and continuous delivery of valuable software is pretty difficult to do.
<ul><li>What is “early”?  Perhaps “incremental” is more appropriate.  I’m assuming this wasn’t intended to be “early” in the traditional, calendar-time based meaning.</li>
<li>Continuous delivery == constantly changing, hopefully for the better.</li>
<li>There is no such thing as “scope creep” in Agile!</li>
<li>It is of value if it satisfies the customer, therefore the customer must determine what “valuable” means.</li>
<li>But… If delivery is continuous, when are we “done”?  Perhaps never.  Satisfaction is a tricky beast.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul><p><span>In life…</span></p>
<ul><li>In order to be satisfied, you must actually understand what you really <em>need</em> to be happy.
<ul><li>What you want is not necessarily what you need.</li>
<li>Perhaps in order to get at the core of what you really need, you have to ask myself “Why do you want X?”</li>
<li>You can’t “check-out”.  In order for this to work you need to be present and engaged in your life and incrementally improving it.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>You also need to start NOW and continuously deliver on those needs in the form of changes for the better.
<ul><li>&ldquo;Working software&rdquo; in life is a means by which the need is satisfied.  This could be anything from eating well, getting enough rest, to treating yourself with the same kindness and respect you give your friends.</li>
<li>The key is to first really understand what your needs are — what will it take to be satisfied?</li>
<li>And finally, admitting that you am a work-in-progress.  There is no &ldquo;done&rdquo;.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
