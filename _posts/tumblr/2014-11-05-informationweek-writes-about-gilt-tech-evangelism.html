<p>The IT publication InformationWeek <a href="http://www.informationweek.com/strategic-cio/team-building-and-staffing/the-it-talent-shortage-debate/d/d-id/1317128" target="_blank">recently spoke to me</a> about what &ldquo;tech evangelism&rdquo; means at Gilt. An excerpt from &ldquo;The IT Talent Shortage Debate,&rdquo; written by IW Editor-in-Chief Laurianne McLaughlin:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip; Gilt offers <a href="http://tech.gilt.com/search/free+classes" target="_blank">day-long courses</a> on hot skills such as Scala and Hadoop, taught by experts, and has tech gurus such as former Netflix cloud architect <a href="http://tech.gilt.com/search/adrian+cockcroft" target="_blank">Adrian Cockcroft</a> come in to speak. Gilt invites the local tech community to attend and builds in time for networking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What I&rsquo;m set up to do is raise awareness of what&rsquo;s going on here, … and hopefully that will inspire people to apply,&rdquo; Apple says. </p>
