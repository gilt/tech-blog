<p>We&rsquo;re super-excited to welcome <a href="https://twitter.com/garylosh" target="_blank">Gary LosHuertos</a> to Gilt Tech! Gary joins our personalization team&ndash;the crew that focuses on our <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/08/26/gilt-launches-personalized-sales-because-personalization-is-where-its-at/" target="_blank">personal sales</a> and other sexy initiatives&ndash;as aÂ Senior Software Engineer and will work remotely from Gainesville, Florida (he&rsquo;ll also visit us in NYC every once in a while). Gary recently co-founded a start-up and participated in the <a href="http://www.techstars.com/" target="_blank">TechStars</a> program, so he&rsquo;s no stranger to NYC.</p>
<p>Outside of work, Gary enjoys catching up with HBO&rsquo;s many popular shows, eating at some of Gainesville&rsquo;s &ldquo;(few) wonderful restaurants,&rdquo; and &ldquo;adding fluffy descriptive adjectives to my sentences.&rdquo;</p>
