<p>On Friday Gilt had the honor of hosting more than 30 University of Virginia students and 20 U of VA alumni at a &ldquo;<strong><a href="http://www.nycedc.com/program/nyc-tech-talent-draft-program" target="_blank">Tech Talent Draft</a></strong>&rdquo; panel discussion organized by the New York City Economic Development Corporation. Gilt panelists Ryan Caloras (software engineering), Dominique Essig (VP, Product Management and User Experience), Geoff Guerdat (Director, Data Engineering) and Keith George (SVP and General Manager of Men&rsquo;s and Home) described how they landed at Gilt, what their day-to-day entails, and how to prepare for a career in tech.</p>
<p>After the panel, NYC-based UVA alumni&ndash;including <a href="http://vanessahurst.com/" target="_blank">Vanessa Hurst</a> from Developers for Good and Rebecca Conti from <a href="http://www.goldenseeds.com/" target="_blank">Golden Seeds</a>&ndash;mixed and mingled over pizza and drinks until a bit past 8 PM. Thanks to everyone who attended, and to the NYC EDC for organizing such a fun event!</p>
