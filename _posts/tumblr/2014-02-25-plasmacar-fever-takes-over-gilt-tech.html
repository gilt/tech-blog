<p>One Friday morning in early February, the lives of many a Gilt technologist changed forever when a <a href="http://plasmacar.com/#page-1" target="_blank">PlasmaCar</a> showed up in our 2 Park office. Since that fateful Friday, a whole culture of PlasmaCar racing and competition has sprung up in both our NYC and Dublin offices&ndash;with official racing courses, official regulations, and official scoreboard, and official timekeepers (they wear silvery &ldquo;marshal&rdquo; badges). The friendly folks at PlasmaCar HQ heard about our activities and have helped us grow our fleet from one to <em>five </em>PlasmaCars. Man and woman, short and tall (as well as super-tall&ndash;like, 6'8&quot; tall), adult and child-like adult, junior software engineer and Apache project committer, tech exec and whole-company exec: all of the above have been spotted (sometimes after hours) riding around, Plasma-style.</p>
<p>&ldquo;PC Fever&rdquo; has also spread to other Gilt departments&ndash;here are Tyler Thoreson (VP, Men&rsquo;s &amp; Home Editorial, Creative &amp; Customer Experience) and Tracy Lomerantz Lester (Editorial Director, Women&rsquo;s &amp; Kid&rsquo;s) helping to make our PlasmaCars famous:</p>
