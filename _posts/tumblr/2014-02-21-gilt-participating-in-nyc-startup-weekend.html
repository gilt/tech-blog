<p>If you&rsquo;re one of the many aspiring entrepreneurs attending this weekend&rsquo;s <a href="http://nyc.startupweekend.org/" target="_blank">NYC Startup Weekend</a> in the hopes of launching a successful new company or product in ~54 hours, be on the lookout for a friendly fellow wearing a Gilt Tech T-shirt. That would be Ryan Caloras, a software engineer on the Gilt personalization team. Ryan&rsquo;s an entrepreneur himself: Before joining Gilt he was a co-founder and developer of <a href="http://www.coolhandjuke.com/" target="_blank">Cool Hand Juke</a>, which enables users to control the music at bars and cafes using a smart phone. He&rsquo;ll be mentoring Startup Weekend attendees on how to launch a startup. Go seek his advice!</p>
<p>Ryan&rsquo;s not the first Gilt technologist to participate in Startup Weekend activities. Scott Thompson&ndash;another engineer on our personalization team&ndash;<a href="http://blog.up.co/2013/04/02/s-o-summit-2013-the-journey/" target="_blank">served as a mentor</a> at last June&rsquo;s Startup Weekend. And GiltÂ Senior Software Engineer Sean Sullivan went to the 2013 <a href="http://blog.up.co/2013/04/02/s-o-summit-2013-the-journey/" target="_blank">Global Organizer Summit</a> in Rio.</p>
