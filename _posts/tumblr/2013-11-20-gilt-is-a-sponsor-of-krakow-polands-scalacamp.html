<p>Gilt Senior Software Engineer Lukasz Szwed, who&rsquo;s based at our Dublin office, will be flying eastward soon to present at the Krakow Scala Users Group&rsquo;s upcoming <a href="http://scalacamp.pl/" target="_blank">ScalaCamp</a> meetup. As ScalaCamp&rsquo;s featured presenter, Lukasz will talk about Gilt&rsquo;s development and deployment infrastructure in continuous-innovation mode with Scala, and also describe the evolution of our architecture from a monolithic Rails application to a constellation of more than 300 microservices written in Scala. As Lukasz notes in his abstract, &ldquo;we’re able to provide more value to our customers and adapt to changes more effectively when our developers can focus on coding and <strong><a href="http://tech.gilt.com/2013/09/27/which-scala-testing-tools-should-you-use" target="_blank">testing</a></strong>, and not on other tasks that can be automated instead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In addition to Lukasz&rsquo;s talk, ScalaCamp will feature a presentation by AGH researcher and independent software consultant Marcin Jarząb on Apache Kafka. The event will close with networking and a pub visit. Sounds like fun! ScalaCamp takes place Thursday, November 28 (5:30 PM) at Katedra Informatyki AGH, Building D-17 in Krakow. <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Krakow-Scala-User-Group/events/148248482/" target="_blank"><strong>RSVP here</strong></a>!</p>
