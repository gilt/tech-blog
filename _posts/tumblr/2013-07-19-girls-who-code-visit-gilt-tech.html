<p>Recently Gilt had the pleasure of hosting a group of young women from <a href="http://www.girlswhocode.com/" target="_blank">Girls Who Code</a>&ndash;a nonprofit organization aimed at achieving gender parity in the technology sector. This was the second time we hosted GWC; last year&rsquo;s delegation <a href="http://tech.gilt.com/2012/08/08/a-big-thanks-to-this-years-girls-who-code-field" target="_blank">voted us</a> as the #1 workplace, so we aimed to live up to our reputation.</p>
<p>We started things off by giving the girls a brief introduction to Gilt Tech, including an overview of our agile development process and a description of the tech team roles. We then divided the group into teams of three and asked each team to design a web page based on the theme, &ldquo;welcoming Girls Who Code to Gilt.&rdquo; Some of the girls had HTML experience, others did not, but they all quickly found roles&ndash;including project manager, UX designer or coder. They formed mini-versions of our Gilt teams! We were very impressed with their work:</p>

<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-67dba9e8-f363-08d7-1afd-c5fe861e45be">The web page exercise turned out to be a hit&ndash;the girls didn&rsquo;t want to stop working!<br/></span></p>
<p>The visit ended with a tour of the Gilt office and a question/answer session featuring Gilt women technologists. The girls&rsquo; energy was inspiring to see&ndash;it&rsquo;s clear that they are all extremely intelligent, driven and have bright futures ahead of them. We look forward to seeing them again in their careers!</p>
