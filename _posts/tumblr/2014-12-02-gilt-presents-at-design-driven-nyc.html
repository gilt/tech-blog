<p>It&rsquo;s been an even busier-than-usual month for Gilt Director of Product <a href="http://tech.gilt.com/search/andrew+chen" target="_blank">Andrew Chen</a>. In addition to <a href="http://tech.gilt.com/2014/11/10/betting-on-china-gilts-relaunch-into-the-worlds" target="_blank">breaking down Gilt&rsquo;s product and UX strategy for Singles&rsquo; Day in China</a> and being quoted by <a href="http://tech.gilt.com/2014/11/12/bloomberg-covers-gilts-singles-day-relaunch-in" target="_blank">Businessweek</a>, he&rsquo;s been preparing for his upcoming talk at <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Design-Driven-NYC" target="_blank">Design Driven NYC</a>: a new meetup group focused on the intersection of design, user experience, and technology. Tomorrow, Andrew will join speakers from Codecademy, Cover and other tech companies at WeWork Soho West, which hosts <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Design-Driven-NYC/events/218594234/" target="_blank">Design Driven NYC #2</a>. There&rsquo;s a wait-list for tomorrow&rsquo;s event, but RSVP anyway and cross your fingers.</p>
