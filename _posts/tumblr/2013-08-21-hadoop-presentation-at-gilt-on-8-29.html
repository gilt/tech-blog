<p>On Thu 8/29, Gilt will host the New York Hadoop Users Group&rsquo;s next meetup at our 2 Park Ave. office. Hortonworks Solutions Engineer Abhijit Lele will present &ldquo;Developing Applications with Hadoop 2.0 and YARN,&rdquo; an examination of YARN architecture and how to get started developing forÂ  Hadoop 2.0. YARN is Hadoop&rsquo;s next-generation resource management framework, and enables Hadoop to grow beyond its MapReduce origins to embrace multiple workloads spanning interactive queries, batch processing, and streaming. </p>
<p>The event begins at 6 PM. There are only a few seats left, so <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Hadoop-NYC/events/133357872/" target="_blank">RSVP</a> ASAP. </p>
