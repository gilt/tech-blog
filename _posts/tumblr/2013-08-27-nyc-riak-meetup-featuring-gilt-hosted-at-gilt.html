<p>We&rsquo;re excited to announce that Gilt CTO and co-founder Michael Bryzek and Lead Software Engineer Jim Englert are featured presenters at the next NYC Riak meetup, which we&rsquo;ll host at our Manhattan office on Tuesday, September 17. Michael will start off the evening with a brief intro, and Jim will give a presentation based on his recent account of <a href="http://tech.gilt.com/2013/07/15/riak-passes-the-stress-test" target="_blank">our Riak stress test in Dublin</a>. Rounding out the evening is Basho Technologies evangelist Tom Santero, who will discuss the next generation of Riak search.
