<p>How does Gilt apply personalization strategies to attract, interact with, and persuade customers to make high-end purchases? Find out at the Brooklyn Tech Meetup&rsquo;s Dec. 10 event, featuring Gilt VP Personalization Erik Lumer! Eric will discuss what we call “smart serendipity”: the discovery of surprising, albeit personally relevant items. He&rsquo;ll also explain how Gilt implements this strategy on our platform, both at the end-user interface and predictive affinity engine levels, to personalize shopping experiences for millions of users.</p>
<p>In addition to Erik&rsquo;s talk, the meetup features presentations from the time-management app Sociidot and the consumer preference data outfit Have to Have, as well as &ldquo;crazy views, rotating panels, and even interactive LED lighting!&quot;  <strong><a href="http://www.meetup.com/BKtechmeetup/events/141894972/" target="_blank">RSVP here</a></strong> to catch Erik&rsquo;s talk (and those LED lights)!</p>
