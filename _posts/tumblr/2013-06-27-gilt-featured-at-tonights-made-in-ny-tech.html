<p>Tonight (Thu 6/27) Gilt CTO Michael Bryzek will appear alongside tech leaders from Knewton, ZocDoc and other NYC-based companies at &ldquo;<a href="http://www.meetup.com/techinmotionnyc/events/123058112/" target="_blank">Made in NY: Tech Panel</a>,&rdquo; an event hosted by Tech in Motion. Bryzek and the other panelists will discuss <span>building a tech team from scratch, the future of NYC&rsquo;s tech scene, and why NYC is such a great place to start a tech company, among other topics. Seven hundred people signed up for the event, and (as of this typing) another 54 are still waiting to gain admission. In fact, the response was so overwhelming that the organizers had to move the event to a much larger location to accommodate more people. Impressive! </span></p>
<p><span>Thanks to Tech in Motion for inviting Gilt to take part in what promises to be a lively and enlightening discussion. We&rsquo;ll follow up with a recap, so stay tuned!<br/></span></p>
