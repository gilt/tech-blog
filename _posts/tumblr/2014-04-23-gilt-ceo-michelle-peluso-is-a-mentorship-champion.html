<p>This year the <a href="http://www.suwn.org" target="_blank">Step Up Women&rsquo;s Network</a> named Gilt CEO <a href="http://www.gilt.com/company/bio/michelle-peluso-0" target="_blank">Michelle Peluso</a> their 2014 Mentorship Champion! Step Up is a nonprofit that empowers teen girls from under-resourced communities, supports professional women with career development, and promotes mentorship and financial support for both girls and women. Tomorrow (April 24) Step Up will honor Michelle at their Power Hour fund-raising event at the Hearst Tower in NYC. Other Gilt leaders, including COO Tracey Weber, VP Product Management and User Experience <a href="http://tech.gilt.com/search/dominique+essig" target="_blank">Dominique Essig</a>, and Gilt Senior Director, PMO <a href="http://tech.gilt.com/search/heather+fleming" target="_blank">Heather Fleming</a>, will also be at the event to mentor and connect with the crowd.</p>
<p>In related: In a <em>New York Times </em>interview published last weekend, Michelle talks about some of her own sources of inspiration:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My grandparents had a bunch of different businesses after the war. My dad is an entrepreneur too — he runs an environmental engineering firm. He’s a huge role model for me. He was just authentically passionate about his people. His employees were a big part of our lives. At company picnics, you would be expected, as a kid, to remember the names of the 200 people who worked at his company, as well as their spouses and kids. My mom was a teacher, and she loves the idea of curiosity. She wanted me to love learning.</p>
