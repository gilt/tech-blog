<p>At Gilt, we&rsquo;re passionate about promoting the technologies that we use and love. What better way to drive adoption of our favorite technologies than by sharing our knowledge and resources with the community? With that in mind, we&rsquo;re launching a program to regularly offer <strong>free</strong> technology training to the public at our offices in NYC and Dublin, Ireland.</p>
<p>To kick off our exciting new initiative, we&rsquo;re offering a one-day &ldquo;Programming Scala&rdquo; course on July 1 that repeats on July 2. Teaching the course will be <a href="http://agiledeveloper.com/" target="_blank">Dr. Venkat Subramaniam</a>: author of <em><a href="http://pragprog.com/book/vsscala/programming-scala" target="_blank">Programming Scala</a></em> and several other books, adjunct professor at the University of Houston, and frequent speaker at international conferences. Spend a day learning from a Scala expert, meeting some of Giltâ€™s friendly engineers, and having fun! <strong><br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>When:</strong> July 1 and 2, 2013; training days will last approximately nine hours (includes working lunch)</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong> Gilt HQ (2 Park Ave., New York City, NY)</p>
