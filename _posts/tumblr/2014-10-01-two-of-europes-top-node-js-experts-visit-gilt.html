<p>Yesterday the #gilttech team in NYC hosted two very special guests: nearForm co-founders <a href="http://@Cianomaidin" target="_blank">Cian Ó Maidín</a> (CEO, pictured above) and <a href="https://twitter.com/rjrodger" target="_blank">Richard Rodger</a> (CTO), who spent more than an hour sharing with us their vast knowledge of using Node.js with micro-services. Based in Waterford, Ireland, Cian and Richard founded nearForm in 2011 largely because they were super-excited about Node.js. That passion has paid off for them in many ways (do what you love, right?).</p>
<p>In addition to running the largest Node consultancy in Europe, Cian and Richard write books on Node.js, provide Node training, and run the blog Node Crunch (Richard&rsquo;s recent article, &ldquo;<a href="http://www.nearform.com/nodecrunch/deployment-youre-wrong/" target="_blank">Deployment: You&rsquo;re Doing It Wrong</a>,&rdquo; cites our own Michael Bryzek&rsquo;s <a href="http://tech.gilt.com/2014/07/02/immutable-infrastructure-with-docker-and-ec2-gilt-at" target="_blank">DockerCon talk on &ldquo;Immutable Infrastructure with Docker and EC2</a>&rdquo;&ndash;thanks, Richard!). Cian is a cofounder and curator of <a href="http://www.nodeconf.eu/" target="_blank">NodeConf.eu</a>, Europe&rsquo;s largest Node conference (and <a href="http://tech.gilt.com/2014/09/22/gilt-goes-to-nodeland-a-recap-of-nodeconf-eu" target="_blank">attended by our own team</a> this year). And Richard created <a href="http://nodezoo.com/" target="_blank">nodezoo.com</a>, a search engine for <a href="http://nodejs.org" target="_blank">Node.js</a> modules. Thanks to both of them for spending time with us!</p>
