<p>What&rsquo;s the NYC Fashion Hack Day? On Saturday, June 16, 2012, Gilt Tech is joining forces with two giants of their respective industries: <a href="http://www.apigee.com" target="_blank">Apigee</a>, in the business of <a href="http://apigee.com/about/products/enterprise" target="_blank">APIs</a> and <a href="http://apigee.com/about/products/usergrid" target="_blank">cloud platforms</a>, and <a href="http://www.tumblr.com" target="_blank">Tumblr</a>, in the business of <a href="http://www.tumblr.com/about" target="_blank">hosting and spreading the word about art and creativity</a> and <a href="http://www.maddieonthings.com" target="_blank">blogs about dogs on top of things</a>. Together, we&rsquo;re excited to host a 12-hour hackathon event at Gilt HQ in Midtown Manhattan in search of individuals and small teams who want to spend the day building a brand new application: web, desktop, mobileâ€¦ whatever suits your fancy, we&rsquo;d love to see you come out and make something!</p>

<p>All three companies will have people on hand to help you get up and running with our APIs &amp; tools if that&rsquo;s your thing, or else you can just come and work on a project if the idea of making something while meeting and networking with the NYC Tech scene is appealing to you.</p>

<p>At the end of the day we&rsquo;ll be giving out prizes for best usage of the hosts&rsquo; APIs, most fashion-conscious application, and coolest technical accomplishment! Tickets are limited, so <a href="http://nycfashionhackday.eventbrite.com/" target="_blank">sign up today</a> to reserve your spot!</p>
