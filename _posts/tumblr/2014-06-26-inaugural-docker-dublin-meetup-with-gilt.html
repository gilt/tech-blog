<p>After going west to tell the audience at <a href="http://dockercon.com/" target="_blank">DockerCon 2014</a> about our work with Docker, Gilt Co-Founder and CTO Michael Bryzek is heading east across the Atlantic to headline Docker Dublin&rsquo;s first-ever meetup! <span>Michael will discuss how Gilt’s engineering team has been experimenting with Docker to improve and simplify end-to-end continuous delivery of our micro-services architecture, which to date includes more than 300 micro-services. He’ll highlight some of the benefits Docker offers to engineers, such as stability, repeatability, and the flexibility to create lightweight environments. Finally, he&rsquo;ll discuss how Gilt is using Docker in AWS to provide immutable software deployments to production.</span></p>
<p><span>If you&rsquo;re excited about Docker and live in Dublin (or have a pet whale who&rsquo;s willing to transport you there), you should definitely attend this event! The meetup takes place Wednesday, July 9 at Engine Yard; <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Docker-Dublin/events/191234532/" target="_blank">go here</a> to RSVP. Hope to see you (and your whale) there :)</span></p>
