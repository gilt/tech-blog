<p>In Boston for <a href="http://backboneconf.com" target="_blank">BackboneConf</a>? Be sure to check out &ldquo;The Geologic Time Scale of Gilt.com&rsquo;s View Layer,&rdquo; the presentation that Gilt Lead Software Engineer <a href="https://twitter.com/markwunsch" target="_blank">Mark Wunsch</a> will give today (7/31) at 3 PM EST. The details on Mark&rsquo;s talk:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The &ldquo;best practices of architecting, designing, and managing the V in MVC have evolved over the course of time. The act of modernizing a web application reveals the layers of previous approaches lurking just underneath the crust. This talk will dive through the strata of the View layer of Gilt.com. Every day, Gilt builds a dynamic shopping experience for each of our millions of customers and awaits their timed onslaught. How do business strategies, re-architectures, new technologies, and a rabid customer base shape and re-shape the View? We will move across Eras: from Ruby on Rails and early Ajax techniques, to lightweight Java frameworks, to our current day; where asset management pipelines and JavaScript MVC frameworks are de rigueur. We&rsquo;ll discuss concerns like page performance, pagination, and search engine optimization through the lens of our Views present and past.</p>
