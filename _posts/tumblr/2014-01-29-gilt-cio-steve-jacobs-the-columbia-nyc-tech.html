<p>Last night Gilt CIO and Columbia alum Steve Jacobs (PhD, Electrical Engineering) visited his alma mater to participate in a lively panel discussion hosted by the <a href="http://www.nycedc.com/program/nyc-tech-talent-draft-program" target="_blank">NYC Tech Talent Draft</a>. Steve joined representatives from Buzzfeed, Adobe, Fog Creek Software and other top NYC tech companies in answering questions about how to land a tech job in NYC, the kinds of exciting challenges that professional engineers get to work on and solve every day, and other career-related topics. Gilt Product Manager and fellow Columbia alum Jeff Bobula also attended the panel to answer questions about <a href="http://www.gilt.com/careers/department/technology-product-management/" target="_blank">career opportunities at Gilt</a> and the skills one needs to build a successful career in product management.</p>
