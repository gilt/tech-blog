<p>We&rsquo;re excited to welcome Jenny Leahy to the Gilt technology team! Jenny will be working in our Dublin office as a software engineer, and will initially focus on email delivery. A longtime Java developer with experience working in the financial software field, she&rsquo;s moving into the world of Scala and is intrigued by <a href="http://typesafe.com/blog/play_framework_akka_and_scala_at_gilt" target="_blank">our use of the Typesafe platform</a>. When she&rsquo;s not working, she loves to read (sci-fi, psychology and anthropology) and travel.</p>
