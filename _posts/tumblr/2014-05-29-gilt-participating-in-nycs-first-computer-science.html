<p>Reaching out to young and aspiring technologists is a major priority for the #gilttech team. From hosting <a href="http://tech.gilt.com/2013/08/26/meet-a-gilt-technologist-nikita-and-diana" target="_blank">Girls Who Code</a> to inviting <a href="http://tech.gilt.com/2014/04/03/bronx-academy-of-software-engineering-students-visited" target="_blank">Bronx Academy of Software Engineering students</a> to tour our offices, we&rsquo;ve derived immeasurable value from outreaching to the next generation of software engineers, mobile developers, and program managers. So when our friends at the <span><span><a href="http://www.nycedc.com/" target="_blank">New York City Economic Development Corporation</a> invited us to participate in <span><span>NYC&rsquo;s first <a href="http://www.tealsk12.org/events/y2014/fieldtrip/nyc/" target="_blank">Computer Science Opportunity Fair</a></span></span>&ndash;an event expected to draw 400 high schools students eager to<span><span> learn about computer science education&ndash;we were excited. </span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>Held at Microsoft&rsquo;s office in Times Square, tomorrow&rsquo;s Opportunity Fair is a partnership between the NYCEDC and <a href="http://www.tealsk12.org/" target="_blank">Technology Education And Literacy in Schools</a> (TEALS)&ndash;the latter a program, coordinated by <span><span><span>Microsoft, that brings CS instruction to public schools. The #gilttech delegation&ndash;software engineers <a href="http://tech.gilt.com/2014/04/03/bronx-academy-of-software-engineering-students-visited" target="_blank">Paolo Lim, Paul Lee</a>, <a href="http://tech.gilt.com/search/jennifer+shin" target="_blank">Jennifer Shin</a>, Artie Motamed and <a href="http://tech.gilt.com/search/archana+kumar" target="_blank">Archana Kumar</a></span></span></span><span><span><span>&ndash;will be on-site from <span><span><span><span><span><span><span>10 AM-2:15 PM to answer questions about our tech stack (and technology in general), demonstrate <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/gilt_groupe" target="_blank">our API lessons on Codecademy</a> and share some of their personal experiences about how they became software engineers. Thanks to NYCEDC and TEALs for inviting us to participate.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
