<p>Yesterday Gilt&rsquo;s tech team had the pleasure of welcoming Parse Developer Advocate <a href="https://twitter.com/beardigsit" target="_blank">Bear Douglas</a> to 2 Park to give a lunchtime presentation on the Parse platform. Bear visited us by way of an invite from Gilt software engineers Yoni Goldberg and Ryan Caloras, who caught her fantastic presentation at last week&rsquo;s f<a href="https://fbf8.com/" target="_blank">8 Developer Conference</a> and asked her to present for our team. Bear&rsquo;s passing through NYC this week for <a href="http://techcrunch.com/events/disrupt-ny-2014/event-home/" target="_blank">TechCrunch&rsquo;s Disrupt</a>, so the timing couldn&rsquo;t have been better!</p>
<p>If you are not familiar with Parse, it is an easy-to-use cloud platform that simplifies the back-end implementation of mobile apps; <a href="https://parse.com/" target="_blank">go here</a> to learn more about it. Thanks to Bear for educating us in person yesterday!</p>
