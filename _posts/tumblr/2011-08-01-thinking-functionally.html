<p><strong>Thinking Functionally: </strong>Programmers are beginning to rediscover this powerful style of programming.  The prominence of multicore processors and the emergence of multiple languages  on the JVM is reigniting strong interest in this paradigm. In this presentation we&rsquo;ll look at what functional programming is,  why we should care about it, and how to make use of it in our daily programming activities.</p>
