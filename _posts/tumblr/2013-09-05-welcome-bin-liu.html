<p><span>Please say hello to Bin, who just joined our Gilt City team as a software engineer. Bin will be working primarily in Scala to enhance our personalization efforts. He&rsquo;s a full-stack engineer who has worked mainly in Python/Django, with specialization in data aggregation and platform engineering. He&rsquo;s excited about the opportunity to program in the technologies we use here. He likes sports&ndash;&ldquo;almost all of them.&rdquo;</span></p>
