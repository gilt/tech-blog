<p>Gilt is ecstatic to welcome Felix Garcia Borrego to the #gilttech engineering team in Dublin! Felix (to clarify, that&rsquo;s him on the left) will join our Real Time Team and help us to take our real time event system to the next level using <span><span>Amazon Kinesis and other </span>cloud technologies.<br/><br/> Originally from Seville, Spain, Felix worked at <a href="http://viafirma.com/" target="_blank">his own start-up</a> for about eight years, building both mobile apps and web apps. Recently he decided to move abroad and look for new adventures, and found his way to Gilt!<br/></span></p>
<p><span>Like many on our team, Felix got his start in computer programming (and Lego) at a very early age. He&rsquo;s just realized that Scala is a better language than Lego or Java for building reactive systems. &ldquo;Programming is my hobby too, but I also enjoy practicing sports, traveling and reading science fiction novels,&rdquo; he says. Welcome, Felix!</span></p>
