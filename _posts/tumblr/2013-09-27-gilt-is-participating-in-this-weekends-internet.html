<p>Tonight Your Gilt Tech Evangelism Department is appearing at the <a href="https://iothacknyc.eventbrite.com/" target="_blank">Internet of Things Hackathon</a> to promote the <a href="https://dev.gilt.com/" target="_blank">Gilt APIs</a>. Some hackathon details:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span>The challenge for this series of hackathons is to craft new ways that the processor and <span><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=all+in+one+pc&amp;oq=all+in+one+pc&amp;aqs=chrome.0.0j5j0l2j69i62l2.1758j0&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8" target="_blank"><span>All In One PC</span></a></span> can be an integral part of the family experience. Ideas and interactivity models range from <span><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantified_Self" target="_blank"><span>quantified self</span></a></span> to multi-device, multi-player gaming and beyond. While we are not asking you to create a <span><a href="http://science.howstuffworks.com/innovation/inventions/5-future-inventions-everyones-been-waiting-for.htm#page=10" target="_blank"><span>robot of the future</span></a></span>, there are ways of utilizing the microprocessor at home for interesting interactivity models. </span></p>
<p><span>This specific event will focus on education and we will have students from <a href="http://nycgenerationtech.com/" target="_blank">GenTech</a> on site learning about development.  We highly encourage teams to work with these students, whom will be competing for separate prizes, in order to build apps that disrupt education in meaningful ways. Their feedback will be invaluable to you in building meaningful apps that will attract users from your target audience.<br/></span></p>
<p><span>So the challenge is simple: Create an app that involves an AIO PC and mobile phones. There will be additional prizes and bonus points for eduaction related apps. Create what you imagine. Create your world.  <br/></span></p>

<p><span>Other companies participating include SendGrid, Intel and Pearson. Maybe we&rsquo;ll see you there? <br/></span></p>
