<p>This week we (the Dublin team) went to a wine tasting hosted by <a href="http://www.conosur.com/" target="_blank">Cono Sur</a>, one of the biggest producers of <a href="http://www.conosur.com/our-pinot-noir/our-pinot-noir" target="_blank">Pinot Noir</a> worldwide. One reason why we like Cono Sur is because they feature a <a href="http://www.conosur.com/our-wines/cono-sur-single-varietal/" target="_blank">bicycle</a> on their labels, and at Gilt we like bicycles.</p>
<p>The highlight of the evening was that our very own Jenny Leahy won the main prize: six bottles of excellent red and white wine.</p>
