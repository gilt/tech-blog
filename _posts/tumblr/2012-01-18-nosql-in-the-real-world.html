<p>For the last couple of years the interwebs have been abuzz with discussion on the relative merits of NoSQL database technology, but how has it performed in real world deployments?</p>
<p>Please join us for the second of the Gilt technical meetups to hear prominent local technology companies present on their experiences using Redis, Cassandra, MongoDB, CouchDB and Riak in production environments.</p>
<p>The event takes place on Wednesday, February 8th at 6pm. It&rsquo;s free of charge on a first come first served basis. We expect it to sell out so reserve your spot early!</p>
