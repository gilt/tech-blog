<p>How do you scale a technology organization? What is &ldquo;smart serendipity,&rdquo; and what does it have to do with personalization? And how can you effectively bridge the communication gap between engineers and other stakeholders? Find out by attending the New York Technology Council&rsquo;s &ldquo;<strong>Built to Scale</strong>&rdquo; series featuring presentations by three Gilt technologists, and hosted at our Manhattan (2 Park Ave.) office.</p>
<p>The Tech Council kicks things off on Wed <strong>9/25</strong> at 6 PM with &ldquo;<a href="https://www.nytech.org/events/Build-to-scale-Gilt" target="_blank">Trust: The Secret to Scaling a Tech Organization</a>&rdquo; by Gilt CTO and co-founder <strong>Michael Bryzek</strong>. Michael will highlight what it truly takes to build a team of high-caliber engineers, how to manage and effectively and implement successful decision-making processes, and how to create a culture of trust, among other topics.</p>
<p>On <strong>Tue 10/1</strong> at 6 PM, VP of Personalization <strong>Erik Lumer</strong> will discuss &ldquo;<a href="https://www.nytech.org/events/Build-to-Scale-Gilt-2" target="_blank">The Art of Personalization on the Gilt eCommerce Platform</a>.&rdquo; Erik will describe what we call &ldquo;smart serendipity,&rdquo; or the discovery of surprising albeit personally relevant items. Attendees will learn how Gilt implements this strategy on both the end-user interface and predictive affinity engine levels to personalize shopping experiences for our millions of users.</p>
<p>Finally, on <strong>Thu 10/10</strong> Senior Systems Business Manager <strong>Susan Thomas</strong> ends the series with &ldquo;<a href="https://www.nytech.org/events/Build-to-Scale-Gilt-3" target="_blank">What Did You Say? Bridging the Communiation Gap Between Product Managers &amp; Stakeholders</a>&rdquo;: a discussion of Gilt&rsquo;s program management strategy and how it fosters clear, effective communication between business and engineering teams.</p>
<p>A brand-new series, &ldquo;Built to Scale&rdquo; is one of the NY Tech Council&rsquo;s many efforts to give the NYC tech community access to information and insights they can implement at their own companies or in their professional roles. We&rsquo;re excited to be a part of it!</p>
