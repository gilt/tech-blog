<p>Dublin-based Software Engineer Erica Mitchell recently joined Gilt&rsquo;s architecture team, <span>and works on</span> building the next generation of our dev tools. She&rsquo;s already gotten into the Gilt groove&ndash;taking our <a href="http://tech.gilt.com/2013/07/30/interested-in-free-scala-training-at-gilts-dublin" target="_blank">Intro to Scala</a> and <a href="http://tech.gilt.com/2013/11/01/our-next-free-tech-course-at-gilt-hadoop-with-mapr" target="_blank">Intro to Hadoop</a> courses and organizing some <a href="http://tech.gilt.com/2013/11/20/gilt-software-engineer-jenny-leahy-is-a-winner" target="_blank">fun</a> group outings!</p>
<p>Before joining Gilt, Erica was a Java/Groovy developer and worked on social networking initiatives <span>(for example, integrating</span><span> social content with mobile devices); converting product build </span><span>systems</span><span> to Gradle; building and </span><span>supporting daily deployments to development, sales demo and test environments; and creating deployment artifacts for deployment engineers for staging. She&rsquo;s also been an Eclipse plugin developer and a Java UI developer. </span></p>
<p><span></span> <span>Outside of work, Erica is a volunteer with <a href="http://www.arthritisireland.ie/" target="_blank">Arthritis Ireland</a>&ndash;leading walking groups and</span><span> helping to deliver the &ldquo;Living Well with Arthritis&rdquo; course</span>. We&rsquo;re excited that she&rsquo;s joined the team!</p>
