<p>The <a href="http://www.meetup.com/nychtml5/" target="_blank">NYC HTML5 meetup group</a> is one of our favorites to attend, so we&rsquo;re super-excited that Gilt Lead Software Engineer <a href="http://tech.gilt.com/search/eric+shepherd" target="_blank">Eric Shepherd</a> is one of the featured speakers for April! Eric&rsquo;s talk, &ldquo;<strong>Matrix of Detection,</strong>&rdquo; goes a li&rsquo; something like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Imagine a three-dimensional space created by X, Y, and Z axes. On the X axis, device detection determines the right quantity of code for the device; on the Y axis, resolution detection responds to the user&rsquo;s screen size; and on the Z axis, feature detection further tailors the experience to the browser&rsquo;s capabilities. With users located at points within this three-dimensional matrix, a single application can be served to everyone.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The night&rsquo;s other featured speakers include <a href="https://twitter.com/rememberlenny" target="_blank">Leonard Bogdonoff</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/denimf" target="_blank">Deni Spasovski</a>. <a href="http://www.meetup.com/nychtml5/events/170965392/" target="_blank">The meetup</a> takes place Wednesday, April 16 at Conde Nast&rsquo;s headquarters. There&rsquo;s currently a wait list, but a spot might become available so sign up and see what happens!</p>
