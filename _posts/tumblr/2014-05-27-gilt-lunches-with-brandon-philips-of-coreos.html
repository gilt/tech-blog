<p>Last Friday <a href="https://coreos.com/" target="_blank">CoreOS</a> CTO <a href="https://twitter.com/BrandonPhilips" target="_blank">Brandon Philips</a> stopped by Gilt&rsquo;s NYC office to give a short demo and have lunch with some of our engineering team. A few non-Gilt engineers also joined us in learning more about what CoreOS (Linux for massive server deployments&quot;) does and how. Thanks to Brandon for interrupting his vacation to join us!</p>
