<p>On Friday afternoon Gilt&rsquo;s tech team was honored to host Dr. Roland Kuhn of <a href="http://typesafe.com" target="_blank">Typesafe</a>, who stopped by our NYC office to have some lunch and to chat with a few of our engineers. Based in Sweden, Dr. Kuhn was passing through NYC on his way from Philadelphia, where the night before he appeared at the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/scala-phase/events/167166802/" target="_blank">Philly Area Scala Enthusiasts</a> meetup and led a live-coding session.</p>
<p>The leader of the Akka Team, and a co-instructor (with Martin Odersky and Eric Meijer) of Coursera&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/reactive" target="_blank">Principles of Reactive Programming</a>&rdquo; course, Dr. Kuhn is also a co-author of the <span class="full"><a href="http://www.reactivemanifesto.org/" target="_blank">Reactive Manifesto</a>. </span>One of the Akka team&rsquo;s most exciting recent projects is <a href="http://www.reactive-streams.org/" target="_blank">Reactive Streams</a>, &ldquo;an initiative to provide a standard for asynchronous stream processing with non-blocking back pressure on the JVM.&rdquo; Here at Gilt we handle live feeds of all kinds, notes Gilt Senior Software Engineer Giancarlo Silvestrin. &ldquo;To haveÂ a standard way to handle them asynchronously with automatic back pressure is something I&rsquo;m really interested in,&rdquo; he says.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to learn more about Reactive Streams, don&rsquo;t miss Dr. Kuhn&rsquo;s <a href="http://info.typesafe.com/acton/form/3608/0037:d-0004/0/index.htm?id=0037" target="_blank">May 7 webinar</a> (9-10 AM PST). Also check out <a href="http://typesafe.com/activator/template/akka-stream-scala" target="_blank">Akka Streams</a>, Typesafe&rsquo;s new, open-source Akka implementation of the Reactive Streams draft specification.</p>
<p>Thanks to Dr. Kuhn for spending Friday afternoon with us!</p>
