<p>Recently <a href="http://www.gilt.com/" target="_blank">Gilt</a> collaborated with Hewlett-Packard and fashion designer Michael Bastian on the MB Chronowing: a super-stylish, <strong>limited-edition smartwatch </strong>(see above) that<strong> <a href="http://www.gilt.com/sale/men/mm/michael-bastian-x-hewlettpackard-1" target="_blank">you can buy <em>exclusively</em> on Gilt starting November 7</a></strong>. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=250770" target="_blank">Sridhar Solur</a> is the Director, Next Gen Computing&ndash;Incubation and Innovation at HP, and the man behind the engineering of this amazing new timepiece.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t consider myself a guru on wearables, but <a href="http://online.wsj.com/articles/michael-bastian-creates-a-smartwatch-that-looks-like-a-watch-1414776232" target="_blank">collaborating with Gilt and Michael Bastian to create this smartwatch</a> has taught me quite a bit about them,&rdquo; he says. When it comes to describing himself, Sridhar&rsquo;s apparently a lot like his latest wearable creation &ndash; i.e., classy and understated. So we&rsquo;ll highlight some of his many accomplishments for you: In addition to founding of HP&rsquo;s Wearables business, he is widely recognized as an expert on cloud computing, product management and mobile devices. One of the cross-platform apps he&rsquo;s developed has been downloaded +40 million times.</p>
<p>Sridhar has generously shared with us&ndash;and you&ndash;his list of the top five things to keep in mind when building wearable tech:</p>
<ol><li>Remember: Fashion is what you wear, and electronics are what you carry. So either make it gorgeous or make it invisible.</li>
<li>Resist the temptation to duplicate the old UI rules of mobile into a wearable.</li>
<li>Use familiar shapes and socially acceptable practices. (For example, screaming commands into a watch may be a tad uncomfortable for many people!)</li>
<li>Trying to sell your wearable as jewelry is not easy. Remember: Jewelry is timeless, and technology is ephemeral.</li>
<li>And finally: less is more. We are already slaves to our phones and live in a hyper-notified world. Wearables/IOT technologies should amplify our ability to absorb information and make it possible for more things to be done <em>for us</em>, not done <em>by us</em>. The less often the wearer has to engage with your smartwatch, the better. The last thing you want is people looking at their smartwatches and driving!</li>
