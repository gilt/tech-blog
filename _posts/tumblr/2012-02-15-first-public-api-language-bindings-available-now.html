<p>7 days ago, we launched our Public API and the accompanying <a href="https://dev.gilt.com" target="_blank">Developer Portal</a>. We&rsquo;ve received a lot of great feedback, updated the Portal a bit to better give you the information you need, and talked to a lot of developers with some really neat ideas for ways to use the API. Now&rsquo;s a great time to get started on your own application!</p>

<p>Today I&rsquo;m here to share some of the hard work that people have been doing, both here at Gilt and in the developer community at large, to make the API more accessible to developers of specific languages. We now have the first API language bindings available for Javascript, Ruby, Objective-C, Scala, and Python!</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s more to come; I&rsquo;ll make sure to update here when we have support for more languages or other libraries that might tickle your fancy. Until then, this should be enough to get you started, right?</p>

<h3>Javascript</h3>

<p>Developed by <a href="http://www.chrisyz.com" target="_blank">Chris Young-Zawada</a> here at Gilt, <a href="https://github.com/gilt/gilt-js-sdk" target="_blank">these Javascript language bindings</a> are available as a jQuery-based implementation, so all you have to do is drop in a recent version of jQuery and this .js file and you&rsquo;re off to the races!</p>

<h3>Ruby</h3>

<p><code>gem install kin</code> is all you need to get started with using the Gilt API in Ruby. Developer <a href="https://github.com/vivekbhagwat" target="_blank">Vivek Bhagwat</a> put together <a href="https://github.com/vivekbhagwat/kin" target="_blank">this rubygem</a> to let Ruby developers worldwide have access to Gilt&rsquo;s great flash sales in their applications. Thanks, Vivek!</p>

<h3>Objective-C</h3>

<p>iOS development is kind of a big deal right now, and what better way to dip your toes in the water or extend the reach of your mobile app empire than to use this <a href="https://github.com/gilt/gilt-ios-sdk" target="_blank">Gilt API iOS client library</a> to integrate Gilt sales data into an app for iPhone, iPod Touch and/or iPad? (That&rsquo;s a rhetorical question. This is the ultimate way to do those things.) The SDK was put together by a crack team of Gilt mobile developers: <a href="https://github.com/louoso" target="_blank">Louis Vera</a> and <a href="http://bklynco.de" target="_blank">Adam Kaplan</a>.</p>

<h3>Scala</h3>

<p>Recently among my friends and, it seems, in the developer community at large, what started as a whisper (&ldquo;Scala is pretty sweet&rdquo;) has turned into a roar (&ldquo;DEPLOY ALL THE SCALA&rdquo;). If you&rsquo;re one of the converts, I&rsquo;m happy to tell you that developers <a href="https://github.com/mnn2104" target="_blank">Moses Nakamura</a> and <a href="https://github.com/vivekbhagwat" target="_blank">Vivek Bhagwat</a> have prepared a fully-tested, simple to use library called <a href="https://github.com/mnn2104/Aurum" target="_blank">Aurum</a> that give you access to the Gilt API. Moses and Vivek win the prize for being the first client library developed outside of Giltâ€” it was up and ready for use fewer than 48 hours after the launch of the API!</p>

<h3>Python</h3>

<p>Not content to rest after that, <a href="https://github.com/mnn2104" target="_blank">Moses</a> put together <a href="https://github.com/mnn2104/PyGilt" target="_blank">a simple Python wrapper</a> for the Gilt API as well. It&rsquo;s currently the slimmest of the client libraries highlighted here today, clocking in at just over 100 lines of code, but supports digging through all of the sales and product information that you need to explore our curated sales and do all kinds of fun stuff with them. Good luck, Pythonistas!</p>
