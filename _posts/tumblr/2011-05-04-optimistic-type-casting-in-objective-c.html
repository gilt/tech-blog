<p>As developers, we often find ourselves dealing with some variant of this scenario: we&rsquo;re iterating through a collection containing mixed object types, and we&rsquo;re only interested in objects of a certain type.</p>
<p>For example, let&rsquo;s say we&rsquo;ve got an <code>NSArray</code> representing desks in a classroom. Each array element corresponds to a specific physical desk, which may or may not be assigned to a student at any given time. If a desk is assigned to a student, the array element will contain an <code>NSString</code> instance whose value is the name of the student assigned to that desk. If a desk is unoccupied, the array will contain a pointer to <code>NSNull</code> instead.</p>
<p>In Objective-C, the code for performing such a task usually looks something like:</p>
<pre>//
// assume the variable 'desks' points to a pre-existing NSArray
//
Class stringClass = [NSString class];
NSUInteger deskCount = desks.count;
for (NSUInteger i=0; i&lt;deskCount; i++) {
	id obj = [desks objectAtIndex:i];
	if ([obj isKindOfClass:stringClass]) {
		NSString* studentName = (NSString*) obj;
	
		NSLog(@"%@ is assigned to desk %u (of %u)", studentName, (i+1), deskCount);
		
		// perform other operations with the student's name
	}
}
</pre>
<p>Using a technique I call &ldquo;optimistic type-casting,&rdquo; we can make the code a little bit tidier.</p>
<p>Optimistic type-casting relies on the fact that in C-based languages (unlike, say, Java), it is possible to assign a typed pointer variable so that it points to a value of a completely different type. If that&rsquo;s a little unclear, it means in Objective-C, we can do stuff like this:</p>
<pre>NSString* myName = (NSString*) [NSNumber numberWithInt:-1];</pre>
<p>Here, we&rsquo;ve assigned <code>myName</code>, which is declared as a pointer to an <code>NSString</code> instance, so that it <em>actually</em> contains a pointer to an <code>NSNumber</code> instance.</p>
<p>Not only will the code above compile without warning, but as long as we only call methods on <code>myName</code> that are implemented by both <code>NSNumber</code> <em>and</em> <code>NSString</code>, the code will execute without crashing, and the compiler will remain silent. Calling <code>[myName doubleValue]</code> works just fine.</p>
<p>This allows us to take the sample code above and eliminate the line containing the <code>studentName = (NSString*) obj</code> cast. We optimistically assume that the object we&rsquo;ve been handed is of the exact type we want.</p>
<p>So, when we retrieve the array value by calling <code>[desks objectAtIndex:i]</code>, we immediately assign it to an <code>NSString*</code> variable instead of putting the value into, say, the type-neutral <code>id</code> object pointer. <em>Then</em> we actually check the object&rsquo;s type to ensure we&rsquo;ve got what we want:</p>
<pre>Class stringClass = [NSString class];
NSUInteger deskCount = desks.count;
for (NSUInteger i=0; i&lt;deskCount; i++) {
	NSString* studentName = [desks objectAtIndex:i];	// no cast needed for type-neutral 'id' return value
	if ([studentName isKindOfClass:stringClass]) {
		NSLog(@"%@ is assigned to desk %u (of %u)", studentName, (i+1), deskCount);
		
		// perform other operations with the student's name
	}
}
</pre>
<p>Doing this saves a line of code, making the signal stand out from the noise a little more. And depending on how the compiler decides to optimize that portion of the code, it may possibly reduce the code&rsquo;s stack footprint by <code>sizeof(NSString*)</code>.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a big optimization, and even if it were implemented across a large codebase, it probably wouldn&rsquo;t make a perceptible difference performance-wise.</p>
<p>But I use it because it&rsquo;s a little bit less text for my brain to parse through as I&rsquo;m reading my code. I also like being able to describe a coding style as &ldquo;optimistic,&rdquo; even if a more apt description of the technique would be <em>Trust, but Verify</em>.</p>

<hr><p><strong>Protip:</strong> While the example above allowed me to illustrate optimistic type-casting, it deliberately ignores a more efficient way of handling the particular problem described. In the example above, if we know that our array will never contain anything other than <code>NSString</code>s and <code>NSNull</code>s, we can rely on the fact that <code>NSNull</code> is a singleton and avoid the overhead of the <code>[obj isKindOfClass:stringClass]</code> call altogether.</p>
<p>Instead, all we need to do is compare the pointer of the object returned by the collection against the pointer of the singleton <code>NSNull</code> instance:</p>
<pre>id nsNull = [NSNull null];
NSUInteger deskCount = desks.count;
for (NSUInteger i=0; i&lt;deskCount; i++) {
	NSString* studentName = [desks objectAtIndex:i];
	if (studentName != nsNull) {
		NSLog(@"%@ is assigned to desk %u (of %u)", studentName, (i+1), deskCount);
		
		// perform other operations with the student's name
	}
}
</pre>
