These include our brand-new &ldquo;save sizes&rdquo; feature; mobile-only, &ldquo;summer specials,&rdquo; and personalized sales. As Yon and Chris explain, feedback from our customers played a significant role in our development of these features, which are designed to make the shopping experience as enjoyable and fun as possible.
