<p><span>“Today’s Best Sellers” is a brand-new Gilt feature that shows our millions of users the day’s most popular products. While the concept of “what’s trending” isn’t new in the retail world, it represents a new way for us to engage our audience by diverging from (while complementing) our traditional, sale-based model. Our sale-based model emphasizes </span><strong>telling stories</strong><span> about our wonderful brands to our customers and the products associated with those brands. With Today’s Best Sellers, we help users discover new products by </span><strong>capitalizing on the immediacy</strong><span><strong> of what’s popular</strong> with other Gilt users </span><em>right now</em><span>.</span></p>

<p><span><span> </span>Today’s Best Sellers helps us fulfill a few key use cases and resolve some user pain-points:</span></p>
<ol><li>
<p><strong>It encourages product discovery </strong><span>through Gilt community crowd-sourcing&ndash;highlighting new products to users who may not have ever considered or noticed those products</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>It saves users’ time </strong><span>by reducing the amount of effort required to browse and bring the product higher in the shopping funnel</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>It enhances confidence </strong><span>that a product being purchased is something others love, too</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>It helps us maintain freshness</strong><span> by weeding out sold-out products</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>It encourages repeat visits</strong><span> because it refreshes daily, given our ever-changing inventory</span></p>
</li>
</ol><p><span id="docs-internal-guid-d44284f1-7dc0-565f-d5ef-611b2f83e113"><span>We A/B test all of our technology products at Gilt. In the +2 months we’ve been testing Today’s Best Sellers, we’ve achieved overwhelmingly positive results in both revenue lift and order conversion.
