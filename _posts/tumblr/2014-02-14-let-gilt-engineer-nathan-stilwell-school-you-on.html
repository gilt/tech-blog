<p><span>Two hundred NYC-area engineers have already RSVPed for next Tuesday&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Full-Stack-Engineering-Meetup/events/159441252/" target="_blank">Full-Stack Engineering</a> meetup at Gilt&ndash;how exciting! Even more exciting: Gilt software engineer <a href="http://tech.gilt.com/2013/06/28/meet-a-gilt-technologist-nathan-stilwell-software" target="_blank">Nathan</a></span><a href="http://tech.gilt.com/2013/06/28/meet-a-gilt-technologist-nathan-stilwell-software" target="_blank"> Stilwell</a> (pictured above) is one of the evening&rsquo;s three featured speakers.</p>
<p>Nathan, a front-end engineer who is part of Gilt&rsquo;s amazing Ninjas team, will give a presentation on <span class="il">WebSockets</span> and how we&rsquo;ve used them successfully to create real-time applications that require full duplex communication. <span>Nathan&rsquo;s talk will include </span>overview of what <span class="il">WebSockets</span> are and how to use the <span class="il">WebSockets</span> API, and describe some of the challenges Gilt&rsquo;s engineering team encountered as it integrated <span class="il">WebSockets</span> into its front-end technologies. He&rsquo;ll discuss why Gilt&rsquo;s team has embraced <span class="il">WebSockets</span> so heartily, how <span class="il">WebSockets</span> application at Gilt differs between front-end and back-end, and how the Gilt team uses <span class="il">WebSockets</span> with the Play Framework. Lastly, he&rsquo;ll talk about his open source project, Socket Wrench: a light wrapper around native <span class="il">WebSockets</span> that is more convenient than the <span class="il">WebSockets</span> API.<em><br/></em></p>
<p>Also on Tuesday&rsquo;s bill: Full-Stack organizer/Greenhouse.io Director of Engineering Mike Boufford on &ldquo;mastering JavaScript,&rdquo; and Vimeo Video Systems Engineer Dieter Plaetinck on Metrics/GraphExplorer. Food and drink provided!</p>
