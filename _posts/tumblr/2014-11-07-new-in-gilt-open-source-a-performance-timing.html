<p>At <a href="http://gilt.com/" target="_blank">Gilt</a>, we are obsessed with our site&rsquo;s performance. We use a variety of tools and design patterns to make sure our user experience is as fast as possible. In addition, our Web Performance team&ndash;Senior Software Engineer Eric Shepherd and me (Gregory Mazurek, Lead Software Engineer)&ndash;is committed to creating internal tools that can help our engineers, designers, and product people create great experiences for our users.</p>
<p>Today we launched an open-source Google Chrome Extension to help everyone see a site&rsquo;s performance in a non-invasive and clear way. It&rsquo;s called <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-performance-timing-ap/nllipdabkglnhmanndddgcihbcmjpfej?hl=en-US&amp;authuser=1" target="_blank">Web Performance API Timing</a> and is available for download for free. In addition, the code that drives the extension is available on <a href="https://github.com/GregM/performance-timing-google-chrome-extension" target="_blank">my GitHub page</a>.</p>
<p>The extension takes advantage of the browser&rsquo;s native Performance Timing API to show the event&rsquo;s respective time and the percentage of the total load time. When you hover over each event, you will see how this timing was calculated.</p>
<p>We hope it&rsquo;s a useful tool for you as you become more and more obsessed with your website&rsquo;s or someone else site&rsquo;s performance. Please let us know what you think!</p>
