<p>Daffodils and tulips aren&rsquo;t the only things growing this spring&ndash;so is the Gilt <a href="http://tech.gilt.com/2014/04/09/welcome-fidan-kasra" target="_blank">Program</a> Management <a href="http://tech.gilt.com/2014/04/08/welcome-justin-vitale" target="_blank">Office</a>! Our latest addition to the PMO is Myron Miller, who will work with our Business Operations team asÂ <span>Senior Program Manager. Myron comes to Gilt with more than 13 years of multi-disciplinary project management experience, including media advertising and health insurance.<br/></span></p>
<p>Born in Connecticut, Myron moved to Manhattan in 2007 and has never looked back. In his spare time, he can be found hanging out with friends, at the theater or philharmonic enjoying a show, or traveling. So if you&rsquo;d ever like to chat about Program Management, Dickens, Sondheim, or Tokyo he&rsquo;s your guy!</p>
