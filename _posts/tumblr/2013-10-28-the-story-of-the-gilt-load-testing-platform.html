<p>Last week Gilt Senior Software Engineer Andrew Duffy traveled to Paris to present at <strong><a href="http://scala.io/" target="_blank">Scala.IO</a></strong>, a two-day conference for Scalasmiths and functional programming enthusiasts. Organized by a multinational committee of Scala devs, Scala.IO featured speakers from Typesafe, Google and other well-known tech companies.</p>
<p>In his talk, Andrew described how Gilt survives our daily, noon EST traffic spikes (illustrated above). Andrew also described his work as a contributor to <a href="https://github.com/gilt/gatling" target="_blank"><strong>Gatling</strong></a>, a great open-source load testing tool built on Scala and Akka that he introduced to Gilt. We now use Gatling as the foundation of our load-testing platform. (Check out the Gatling WebSocket add-on that Andrew recently created <strong><a href="https://github.com/gilt/gatling-websocket" target="_blank">here</a></strong>.)</p>
