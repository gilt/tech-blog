<p>On Tuesday, March 18, Gilt and the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/NYCMAD/events/168007732/" target="_blank">New York Mobile App Developer meetup group</a> (NYMAD) will co-host an exciting tech talk by Gilt Principal Software Engineer <strong>Adam Kaplan</strong>. In &ldquo;Using Akka to Scale Gilt&rsquo;s Massive Push Notification System,&rdquo; Adam will:</p>
<ul><li>describe the engineering behind Gilt&rsquo;s push notification system, which can send three million messages in less than 60 seconds</li>
<li>give a brief history of push notifications at Gilt, then focus on the development of his team&rsquo;s current system: a distributed architecture built with Scala, Akka, ZooKeeper, and other technologies</li>
<li>explain how Akka&rsquo;s clustering capabilities not only make mass messaging possible, but also promote overall system integrity, scalability, and better performance (and, on the business side of things, higher revenues!)</li>
<li>place push notifications in the context of Gilt&rsquo;s general engineering culture, which emphasizes a micro-services architecture, fault tolerance, and (the good kind of) redundancy</li>
<li>give a forward-looking view of where push at Gilt is going &ndash; and how the work his team performs ensures that all of those millions of messages stay on the right side of that line between &ldquo;push notifications&rdquo; and &ldquo;spam&rdquo;</li>
</ul><p>The meetup begins at 6:30 PM&ndash;just <a href="http://www.meetup.com/NYCMAD/events/168007732/" target="_blank">go here</a> to RSVP. Food and beverages on the house. Hope to see you on Tuesday!</p>
