<p>This Wednesday (Feb. 26) Gilt Senior Director, Program Management Office (PMO) Heather Fleming is one of the featured panelists at &ldquo;<span class="inline"><span>Being Comfortable while Being Uncomfortable</span></span>&rdquo;&ndash;a Women in Tech panel organized by ISpossible. Heather and HUGE Experience Director Sophie Kleber will talk about how to flourish in sometimes-uncomfortable or unfamiliar environments, and how to regard being outside one&rsquo;s comfort zone as a fun challenge instead of a reason for anguish/anxiety.</p>
<p>As an added bonus, Gilt QA Engineer <a href="http://tech.gilt.com/2013/06/21/meet-a-gilt-technologist-nithya-venkateswaran-quality" target="_blank">Nithya Venkateswaran</a> will warm up the crowd with a series of improv games, including &ldquo;pass the expression&rdquo; and a &ldquo;pet peeve rant.&quot;Nithya does improv in her spare time and is getting to put her skills to great use!</p>
<p>Attending this women-only event is FREE&ndash;just <a href="http://womenintechispossible.splashthat.com/" target="_blank">RSVP here</a>.</p>
