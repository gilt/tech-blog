<p>#gilttech is excited and honored to host a talk by <span>W. Eric L. Grimson PhD, the Chancellor for Academic Advancement at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology! On Thursday, July 17, we will present &ldquo;MIT: Under the Dome,&rdquo; an interactive discussion with <span>Chancellor Grimson that will </span>include a brief history of MIT and the breadth of the Institute&rsquo;s impact around the world.

He championed <a href="http://www.mitx.org/" target="_blank">MITx</a> and the formation of the Office of Digital Learning; teaches 6.00x, one of the first MITx courses, to more than 200,000 registrants; and has served as thesis supervisor to approximately 50 MIT PhDs. </span></p>
<p><span>Whether you&rsquo;re a software engineer, a computer science student or just curious about the latest innovations underway at one of the world&rsquo;s most elite academic institutions, this event will be a don&rsquo;t-miss!
