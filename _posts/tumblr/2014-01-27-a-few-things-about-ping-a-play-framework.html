<p><span>On January 16 and 17 some of my colleagues and I were in Budapest, Hungary for the first-ever <a href="http://www.ping-conf.com/" target="_blank">Ping conference</a>: a two-day, &ldquo;by the community, for the community&rdquo; get-together for <a href="http://www.playframework.com/" target="_blank">Play Framework</a> users and enthusiasts. It was great! The standard of presentations was really, really high, and the content was extremely relevant to what we&rsquo;re doing here at Gilt.</span></p>
<p>All the talks were recorded and are available <a href="http://www.ping-conf.com" target="_blank">here</a> under &ldquo;Schedule.&rdquo; Some highlights about what you&rsquo;ll find:</p>
<div>
<ul><li>In his great keynote address, Play co-creator <strong>Sadek Drobi</strong> explains why Play Framework is designed the way it is, and why functions are awesome.</li>
<li>Typesafe Senior Engineer <strong>Christopher Hunt</strong> gives an overview of some new tools that will soon be available for managing an app&rsquo;s JS/assets.</li>
<li>Leanovate Software Engineer <strong>Yann Simon</strong> gives the best presentation on the cake pattern I&rsquo;ve ever seen. I still don&rsquo;t like the cake pattern, though :).</li>
<li>LinkedIn Lead Developer (and <a href="http://tech.gilt.com/2013/07/12/play-meetup-recap" target="_blank">recent Gilt guest</a>) <strong>Yevgeniy (Jim) Brikman</strong> gave a brilliant presentation on how you can build a dynamic page by streaming the results of Promises to the browser as the content becomes available.</li>
<li>Typesafe Play Tech Lead <strong>James Roper</strong> explained some of the performance characteristics of a Play web app (especially around thread pools and different types of executors), all with benchmarks</li>
<li>Zengularity engineers <strong>Pascal Voitot </strong>and<strong> Julien Tournay</strong> gave two really entertaining (and mind melting!) presentations: one about<span> typesafe JSON parsing in Play, and another about Scalaz Streams.</span></li>
<li>Hamburg-based engineer<strong> Matthias Nehlsen </strong>gave a front-end Scala talk&ndash;a bit of a rarity&ndash;on using Scala.js for writing non-DOM related, browser-side code in Scala.js and using it with Facebook&rsquo;s React.js library. Scala.js is impressively/surprisingly problem-free, Matthias says, while Angular.js doesn&rsquo;t work well with immutable data structures.</li>
<li><span></span><strong>Grant Klopper</strong> from <em>The Guardian</em> gave a very interesting, funny talk about how the <em>Guardian</em> engineering team is using Play to create their new mobile site. Other tidbits: <em>The Guardian has</em> open-sourced their whole frontend(!); they are doing immutable deployments and continuous delivery (Grant deployed to production during the presentation!); and load-tested their new site using the existing site. If response times in a certain part of the fleet go over a threshold, the fleet is doubled automatically; if that doesn&rsquo;t fix the issue a developer gets paged.</li>
</ul>
