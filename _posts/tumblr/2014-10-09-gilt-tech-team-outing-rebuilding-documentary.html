<p>Earlier this week #gilttech&rsquo;s <a href="http://tech.gilt.com/search/lauren+ribando" target="_blank">Lauren Ribando</a>, <a href="http://tech.gilt.com/tagged/Rangarajan-Radhakrishnan" target="_blank">Rangarajan Radhakrishnan</a> and I headed north to the <a href="http://www.generalsociety.org/" target="_blank">General Society of Mechanics and Tradesmen</a> in Midtown for a public screening of <a href="http://rebuildingmovie.com/world-trade-center-new-york-film/" target="_blank"><em>Rebuilding</em></a>: artist/filmmaker Marcus Robinson&rsquo;s visually stunning documentary about the reconstruction of the World Trade Center site and the men and women who did the work. Robinson started work on his film in 2006&ndash;capturing the construction activity on time-lapse film and through his own wonderful paintings, which are interspersed throughout the film (and currently on exhibit on the 48th floor of Tower 4). Robinson&rsquo;s poignant interviews with carpenters, foremen, surveyors, iron workers, window installers and other workers give a human face to the gargantuan WTC project, and also reflect the intimacy and trust he was able to establish with the crew. <em>Rebuilding </em>makes a powerful statement about the resilience of the human spirit, while documenting the incredible perseverance of both the filmmaker and his subjects.</p>
<p><em>Rebuilding </em>has been featured on the <a href="http://www.history.com/shows/history-films/articles/rebuilding-the-world-trade-center" target="_blank">History Channel</a> and the UK&rsquo;s Channel 4; find out about upcoming showings by signing up for <a href="http://rebuildingmovie.com/world-trade-center-new-york-film/" target="_blank">the film&rsquo;s enewsletter</a>. And if you&rsquo;re in NYC, take some time to visit the Tradesmen&rsquo;s building&ndash;it&rsquo;s <span>a New York City landmark and on the National Register of Historic Places.</span></p>
