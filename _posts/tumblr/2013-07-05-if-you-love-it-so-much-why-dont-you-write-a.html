<p><a href="https://jquery.org/" target="_blank">The jQuery Foundation</a> just posted video of &ldquo;If You Love It So Much, Why Don&rsquo;t You Write a Wrapper Around It?&rdquo;&ndash;my presentation at last month&rsquo;s jQuery Conference in Portland, Ore. In my talk, I focus on the importance of using consistent APIs and taking advantage of other people&rsquo;s work (in the form of third-party code) when working with a large code base. Putting a wrapper around someone else&rsquo;s code can give you the API and feature set you want, while saving you tons of tedious work writing business logic.</p>
<p>The last time I attended jQCon was in 2010, when it was held in Boston. The conference is sponsored by jQuery, and certainly features a fair amount of jQuery-related content, but one of the things I appreciate most about it is its focus on larger-scale, front-end issues of the day. This year was no exception.</p>
<p>Back in 2010, two major themes that emerged during jQCon were pubsub messaging and client-side templating. At that time, Gilt was somewhat behind the curve in these areas. Our front-end team came back from the conference feeling inspired and energized, and built systems to handle both pubsub messaging and client-side templating. One was Gilt.Notify, an adaptation of Peter Higgins&rsquo; <a href="https://github.com/phiggins42/bloody-jquery-plugins/blob/master/pubsub.js" target="_blank">pubsub plugin</a>. The other system was Gilt.Template, which at the time was a template-engine-agnostic wrapper around client-side templating (since different teams were using different template engines). Both of these systems have evolved over time, as we&rsquo;ve normalized to one template engine (<a href="http://handlebarsjs.com/" target="_blank">Handlebars</a>) and added private pubsub channels that function like observers, but both are still part of our new module-based front-end stack.</p>
<p>In 2013, we find ourselves right in line with the current state of the industry. Featured talks covered HTML5 polyfills, CSS3 animations, front-end unit testing, client-side MVC, promises, A/B testing, client-side build tools, and—as the topic of my presentation illustrates—wrapping third-party plugins and libraries. Gilt has been working on all the above over the past couple years, and it was good to know that we&rsquo;re up-to-date with the latest in front-end technology.</p>
