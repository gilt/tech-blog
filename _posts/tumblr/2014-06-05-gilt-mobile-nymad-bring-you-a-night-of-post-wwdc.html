<p>Fresh off their <a href="http://tech.gilt.com/2014/04/28/we-won-the-webby" target="_blank">Webby Award</a> win for best iPhone app (shopping), the Gilt Mobile team is partnering up with <a href="http://www.meetup.com/NYCMAD/events/168007732/" target="_blank">our friends</a> at the New York Mobile App Developer meetup group for <a href="http://www.meetup.com/NYCMAD/events/180107822/" target="_blank">What Would Developers Code?: A Night of Post-WWDC Lightning Talks and Hacking</a>. From 5:30 to 9 PM, all of you mobile developers out there are invited to join Gilt and NYMAD for some fun hacking on new tools unveiled by Apple at the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/wwdc/" target="_blank">Worldwide Developers Conference</a>, which wraps up tomorrow in San Francisco. We&rsquo;ll also have short (five- to ten-minute talks) by WWDC attendees, delicious foods that aren&rsquo;t pizza, and cold beverages! <strong><a href="http://www.meetup.com/NYCMAD/events/180107822/" target="_blank">To RSVP, just go here</a></strong>.</p>
<p>Talks will take place on the hour (5:30, 6:30, 7:30 and 8:30 PM), but feel free to come and go for as long as you wish. If you are going to WWDC, come and share your experiences! If you arenâ€™t attending WWDC, this meetup will be an informative and fun recap.</p>
<p>Three of Gilt&rsquo;s mobile engineers went to WWDC this year&ndash;did you?</p>
