<p>For all of you 9-to-5ers who enjoy your free <a href="http://tech.gilt.com/search/free+courses" target="_blank">Gilt tech courses</a> to take place after work, great news: Our next freebie will be an evening course. The focus: data visualization. But not just <em>any </em>data visualization: This three-hour session will cover visualizations for forests, trees and clustering in the context of visualization for multivariate analysis. Leading the way will be Paul Trowbridge, an adjunct instructor at NYU&rsquo;s Center for Advanced Digital Applications.</p>
<p>Multivariate, high-dimensional data sets pose challenges for low-dimensional visual representation, interpretation and communication. In this class, Paul will explore clustering, trees and Random forests&ndash;three common methods for analyzing multivariate data when classification and prediction are key goals of the analysis. He&rsquo;ll introduce each analysis method, and present visualization strategies and techniques for each method&ndash;focusing on Random forests. He&rsquo;ll review these existing visualization methods, teaching how to produce and interpret each visual. He&rsquo;ll then proceed to explore some visualization strategies to diagnose and study the quality of the prediction and classification output of a Random forest analysis. Each step in his presentation will draw from relevant example data sets.</p>
<p><strong>The essentials:</strong></p>
