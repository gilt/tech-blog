<p>AlleyNYC is one of the most active and vibrant co-working spaces in all of NYC, so we&rsquo;re super-excited that they&rsquo;ve invited Gilt CTO/Cofounder Michael Bryzek to present at Alley Weekly, their Friday speaker series. <a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/event/7855864101" target="_blank">The event</a> begins with a fireside chat at noon, followed by a Q&amp;A session and, at 12:50 PM, lunch! Thanks to the AlleyNYC crew and Sam Hysell of <a href="http://leanstartupmachine.com/" target="_blank">Lean Startup Machine</a> for organizing the event.</p>
