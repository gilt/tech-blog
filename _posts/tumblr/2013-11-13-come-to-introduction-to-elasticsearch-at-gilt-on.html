Hosted by Otis Gospodnetić­&ndash;founder of Sematext and a committer to Apache&rsquo;s Lucene, Solr, Mahout, Nutch and Open Relevance projects&ndash;the meetup group is for anyone who is interested in search, discovery, analytics and related fields: information gathering, extraction, and retrieval, natural language processing, text analytics, data mining, sentiment detection, named entity recognition, and visualizations.</p>
<p>Monday&rsquo;s featured presenter is Sematext Software Engineer Radu Gheorghe, who will discuss what <span>Elasticsearch is and how it can act as your NoSQL data-store while providing quick, flexible and scalable search (for example, indexing logs or storing your product information so customers can search on them).
