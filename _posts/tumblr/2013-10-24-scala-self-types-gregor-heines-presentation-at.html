<p>Here&rsquo;s Gilt Principal Software Engineer giving his talk on Scala self-types during the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Dublin-Scala-users-group/" target="_blank">Dublin Scala Users Group</a>&rsquo;s most recent meetup, which took place earlier this week at Engine Yard&rsquo;s Dublin office. In his talk, <span class="full">Gregor explained how to use self-types to assemble application components at compile time and examine the problems and risks involved in using self-types. He also discussed Scala-style dependency injection and showed how self-types are a typesafe alternative to Spring and other DI frameworks. Check out his slides here: </span></p>
