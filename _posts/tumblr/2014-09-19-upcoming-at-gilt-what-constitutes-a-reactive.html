<p>Gilt&rsquo;s NYC office hosts our first tech meetup of autumn 2014! On Wednesday, Sept. 24, Henrik Engström of <a href="http://typesafe.com/" target="_blank">Typesafe</a> will present &ldquo;What Constitutes a Reactive Application?&rdquo;&ndash;a presentation on Typesafe Activator and the four traits that constitute a reactive application. Henrik will demonstrate, in code, how we use an reactive approach when building Typesafe Activator with Play and Akka. The emphasis will be on how Play is utilized, but there will also be some simple Akka examples. All code examples will be in Scala.</p>
