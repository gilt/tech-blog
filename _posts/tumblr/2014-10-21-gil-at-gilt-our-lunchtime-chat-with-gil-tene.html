<p>The #gilttech team recently had the great pleasure of hosting a lunchtime talk by <a href="https://twitter.com/giltene" target="_blank">Gil Tene</a>, CTO and co-founder of <a href="http://www.azulsystems.com/" target="_blank">Azul Systems</a>, at our 2 Park office. Gilt cofounder/CTO <a href="http://tech.gilt.com/search/michael+bryzek" target="_blank">Michael Bryzek</a> and Lead Software Engineer <a href="http://tech.gilt.com/search/yoni+goldberg" target="_blank">Yoni Goldberg</a>, both of whom presented at this summer&rsquo;s <a href="https://qconnewyork.com/" target="_blank">QCon NY</a>, met Gil at the conference and were impressed by his amazing talk about performance on the JVM (check out a two-hour version of his talk <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_e5hujoTkgY" target="_blank">here</a>). Gil generously shared his knowledge and expertise on latency, measurement (particularly errors of omission of data) and garbage collection (Azul produces a JVM that solves the garbage collection problem).  A huge thanks to Gil for spending the afternoon with us!  </p>
