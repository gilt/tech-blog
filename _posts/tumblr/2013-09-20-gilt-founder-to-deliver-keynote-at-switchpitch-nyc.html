<p>Gilt founder and chairman Kevin Ryan will deliver the <a href="http://switchpitch.com/switchpitchnyc-keynotes/" target="_blank">keynote</a> at SwitchPitch:Â a role-reversal event at which established companies pitch funded innovation projects to qualified start-ups looking for partners. Kevin will join other luminaries (we hear Mayor Bloomberg is scheduled to speak) in presenting at the event, which will also feature reps from some of the world&rsquo;s top companies. (If you&rsquo;ve ever dreamed of partnering up with Time Inc., J. Crew or another household-name brand, this will be a great opportunity to make that happen.)</p>
<p>SwitchPitch takes place Tuesday, Oct. 1 from 2 to 8 PM at NYU&rsquo;s Skirball Center; Kevin&rsquo;s presentation, delivered in fireside-chat format, will begin at 2:15 PM.
