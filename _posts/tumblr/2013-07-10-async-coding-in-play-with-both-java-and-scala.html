<a href="http://www.meetup.com/Play-NYC/events/125123622/">Async Coding in Play with both Java and Scala</a><br/><p>Tonight (Wed 7/10) Gilt once again plays host to the Play NYC meetup. On this evening’s agenda: LinkedIn’s <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/jbrikman" target="_blank">Jim Brikman</a> presents &ldquo;<a href="http://www.meetup.com/Play-NYC/events/125123622/" target="_blank">Async Coding in Play with both Java and Scala</a>,&rdquo; a discussion of the non-blocking IO (NIO) nature of the Play framework:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In this talk, I’ll discuss how Play offers an escape from thread pool hell, how it opens the door to real-time web applications (e.g WebSockets), and how to write asynchronous code in Java and Scala without getting stuck in callback hell.</p>
</blockquote>
