<p>Gilt Principal Engineer Kevin Scaldeferri is one of the <a href="http://cufp.org/conference/sessions/2013/kevin-scaldeferri-gilt-groupe-enabling-microservic" target="_blank">featured presenters</a> at this week&rsquo;s Commercial Users of Functional Programming (CUFP) conference in Boston. Kevin&rsquo;s talk focuses on the evolution of Gilt&rsquo;s production architecture from a single monolithic web application to a <a href="http://tech.gilt.com/2013/06/20/gilts-development-deployment-infrastructure-slides" target="_blank">highly-distributed collection of more than 200 micro-services and small web applications</a>. As Kevin writes: &ldquo;this architectural shift allows greater scalability and faster, less coupled development of new features, but also presents challenges around maintaining consistent development, testing, and deployment processes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kevin&rsquo;s presentation focuses some of the interesting and novel ways we use Scala to address these challenges and implement new features, including:</p>
<ul><li>Creating an SBT uber-plugin to abstract and unify the development process with testing, deployment, and operations</li>
<li>Using the cake pattern to bridge the divide between unit testing and functional testing</li>
<li>Type-safe shared configuration using Zookeeper</li>
<li>Live inventory updates using Play WebSockets and Akka Actors</li>
</ul>
