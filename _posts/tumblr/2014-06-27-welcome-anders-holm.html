<p>Gilt extends a hearty welcome to Anders Holm, who joins our infrastructure team as a Senior Systems Engineer! Based in our Dublin office, Anders will focus on building and automating our production infrastructure. Originally from Sweden, he&rsquo;s been interested in computers since he was little: &ldquo;<span>Got my first &lsquo;puter when I was 8 years old&ndash;a Spectravideo 318 with an MSX cartridge expansion kit. Amazing machine,&rdquo; he says. <br/><br/>When he&rsquo;s not 'puting, Anders can be seen flying planes, riding motorcycles (trial bikes, dirt bikes, sports bikes, customs to tourers), studying martial arts, and running a hypnotherapy clinic. We also hear that he wrestles tyrannosaurs, but can&rsquo;t substantiate the rumor. Welcome</span>, Anders!</p>
