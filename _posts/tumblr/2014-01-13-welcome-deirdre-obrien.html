<p>We&rsquo;re excited to welcome Deirdre O'Brien to our team in Dublin. Deirdre is a program manager and a mechanical engineer by training. She made her way into tech via engineering process support, and then moved on to developing and supporting business systems. In her last position, she worked in product engineering as a program manager&ndash;helping the cloud and platform teams to gain input and visibility from other departments and teams, and keeping projects moving along.</p>
<p>Welcome, Deirdre!</p>
