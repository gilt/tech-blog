<p>Dear Supporters of Gilt Open Source,</p>
<p>We could use a bit of your help! One of our biggest open source projects, apidoc, is in the running for a 2015 DeveloperWeek Award&ndash;and we only found out about it today. We have <strong>until just January 15</strong> to collect votes. Not to boast, but we think apidoc is a great project: If you&rsquo;re a developer, you can use apidoc to create beautiful documentation for your REST services and download native client libraries with no (or almost no) dependencies. It takes a schema-first approach rather than annotation-based solutions, and features an intuitive JSON format. And&ndash;one more time&ndash;it&rsquo;s free and yours to use.</p>
<p>With your support, we think we can win this thing. Are you on board? If so, <strong><a href="http://verticalize.me/technology/index?search_by=apidoc" target="_blank">go here to cast your vote</a></strong>. And let us know if you&rsquo;ve used apidoc for any of your projects&ndash;we&rsquo;d love to know (get in touch via <a href="https://twitter.com/gilttech" target="_blank">Twitter</a> or <a href="https://www.facebook.com/GiltTech?ref=hl" target="_blank">Facebook</a>).</p>
<p>Thank you much,<br/>#gilttech</p>
