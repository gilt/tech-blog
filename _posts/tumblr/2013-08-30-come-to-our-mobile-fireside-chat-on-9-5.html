<p>Maybe you can&rsquo;t make it to Brooklyn on 9/3 for <a href="http://tech.gilt.com/2013/08/23/learn-more-about-gilt-mobile-at-3rd-ward-9-3" target="_blank">our mobile-centric fireside chat</a> because you&rsquo;re avoiding the L train (the <a href="http://www.mta.info/nyct/service/lline.htm" target="_blank">grey signage</a> puts you in a melancholy mood), or because you&rsquo;re having a post-Labor Day party, or because you don&rsquo;t live in North America. No worries: On Thu 9/5, come to Manhattan office for the NY Mobile Startups meetup group&rsquo;s fireside chat featuring Gilt Director of Mobile Product Management Christopher Gonzalez and several other members of our mobile team! To RSVP, <a href="http://www.meetup.com/New-York-Mobile-Startups/events/137544532/" target="_blank">just go here</a>. The evening begins at 6:30 PM and concludes at 8:30 PM.</p>
<p>This info won&rsquo;t benefit all of you who actually do live on other continents, though if you do end up flying in just for the fireside chat we&rsquo;ll make sure to give you a Gilt Tech T-shirt for your efforts.</p>
