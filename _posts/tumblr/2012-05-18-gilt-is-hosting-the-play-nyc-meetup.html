<a href="http://www.meetup.com/Play-NYC/events/63123672/">Gilt is hosting the Play! NYC meetup</a><br/><p>This Monday (May 21) Gilt will host the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Play-NYC/" target="_blank">Play! NYC group</a> in our shiny new office space.</p>

<p>A few of us at Gilt have really taken a liking to the <a href="http://www.playframework.org/" target="_blank">Play! web framework</a>, but we wanted to be able to connect with other engineers so we could share experiences and learn about this exciting new framework. We started this group to fill a void we saw in NYC.</p>

<p>The first meetup of the group will be an easy-going introduction to Play! 2. We&rsquo;ll talk briefly about why Gilt has chosen Play for some of its new applications, and then turn it over to Peter Hausel, one of the core developers of Play.</p>

<p>Peter will be leading an informal session about the best practices surrounding Play development.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re in the NYC area, a Play! expert, a Scala beginner, or just interested in what makes this web framework different, I encourage you to join the group and check out this first meetup.</p>

<p>This Monday, May 21st at 7:30 at Gilt&rsquo;s offices, 2 Park Ave, 5th Floor.</p>
