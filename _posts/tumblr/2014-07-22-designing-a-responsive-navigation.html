<p>As part of our efforts to make the entire Gilt website <a href="http://tech.gilt.com/search/responsive+design+series" target="_blank">responsive</a>, the first major component our team decided to focus on was navigation. Gilt.com&rsquo;s existing navigation was already starting to feel overcrowded with user account links, so we knew that we wanted to minimize the number of elements, reduce its height as much as possible and bring more content above the fold. We also wanted to do a better job of letting users know when they are eligible for discounts or offers. Below you can see what changes we made, as well as what the responsive states look like.</p>

<p>Overall, we&rsquo;ve managed to save 33px of space, align with our mobile app’s look and feel, and highlight what’s truly important to our customers&ndash;discounts!</p>
