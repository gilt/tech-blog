<p><span>We&rsquo;re headbangingly happy to add Mike Melton to our team! Mike lives in Virginia Beach, VA, with his wife and three daughters and will work remotely (at least most of the time) on our Push team, which </span><span>handles our emails and push notifications</span><span>. He&rsquo;s both a heavy metal enthusiast and a trained yoga instructor, which is not as much of a contradiction as it sounds.</span><span> </span></p>
<p><span>Career-wise, Mike has mostly done consulting on government contracts, but managed to find his way into the NYC tech scene in 2012 </span><span>and says he&rsquo;s &ldquo;never been happier or more excited&rdquo; about his work. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m thrilled to join the Push team and can&rsquo;t wait to start contributing,&rdquo; he says.</span></p>
<p><span>Welcome, Mike!</span></p>
