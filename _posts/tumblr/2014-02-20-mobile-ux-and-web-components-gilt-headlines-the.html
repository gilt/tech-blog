<p>Next Tuesday&ndash;that&rsquo;s February 25 (hooray, winter is almost OVER)&ndash;Gilt Lead Engineer (and resident coffee-roasting expert) <a href="http://tech.gilt.com/search/gregory+mazurek" target="_blank">Gregory Mazurek</a> will give a talk targeted to all of you front-end engineers and mobile devs. Titled &ldquo;<a href="http://www.meetup.com/nyccssux/events/156810572/" target="_blank">Gilt Mobile Web, and Web-Components</a>,&rdquo; Greg&rsquo;s talk covers some of the key decisions his team has made in designing the <a href="http://m.gilt.com" target="_blank">Gilt mobile web</a> experience, and how the results relate to the <a href="http://www.gilt.com" target="_blank">full-web Gilt experience</a>. Greg will also discuss his thoughts on the Card UI pattern and introduce the audience to web-components: the latter a collection of standards that, Greg believes, will help engineers and designers create better user experiences on both the mobile web and full-screen.</p>
<p>Greg&rsquo;s talk takes place at Gilt&rsquo;s NYC office (2 Park Avenue). The frontend-friendly <a href="http://www.meetup.com/nyccssux/events/156810572/" target="_blank">NYC CSS/UX meetup group</a> cohosts. Yes, there will be pizza and beer (would we let you starve? No, we wouldn&rsquo;t).</p>
