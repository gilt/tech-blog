<p>Gilt Tech is proud to announce the release of <a href="https://github.com/emaloney/CleanroomLogger#cleanroomlogger" target="_blank">CleanroomLogger</a> 1.0, an open-source logging API for iOS.

</p><p>CleanroomLogger provides a simple, lightweight and performant logging API written in Swift that will be readily understood by anyone familiar with other logging packages like CocoaLumberjack and log4j.

</p><h1>CleanroomLogger Highlights</h1>

<p>CleanroomLogger provides these key features:

</p><ul><li>Classify log messages according to one of five <i>severity levels</i>: <b>verbose</b>, <b>debug</b>, <b>info</b>, <b>warning</b> and <b>error</b>
</li><li>See the source file and line number of each log message recorded
</li><li>Silently ignore messages below a given severity threshold
</li><li>Far more respectful of the calling thread than <code>NSLog()</code>
</li><li>A <code>trace()</code> function that can be used to trace an application&rsquo;s code paths by logging the location of its caller
</li><li>Configurable log behavior that puts the application developer in control of embedded code
</li><li>Extension points that allow custom implementations for (1) log message formatting, (2) message filtering logic, and (3) the recording of log messages to an underlying facility.
</li></ul><h2>Message logging</h2>

<p>Each message sent to the log is associated with a <i>severity</i> value indicating the relative importance of the message.

</p><p>You would send an informational message as follows:

</p><pre>
Log.info?.message("The user has added \(count) items to the cart")
</pre>

<p>If a condition occurs that itself isn&rsquo;t an error, but that might signal future trouble, you might issue a <i>warning</i>:

</p><pre>
Log.warning?.message("We're running low on space!!!")
</pre>

<p>Finally, when things hit the fan, you&rsquo;ve got:

</p><pre>
Log.error?.message("Oh my, this is extremely embarrassing")
</pre>

<p>Each log message is recorded with the file and line that issued it, so you can very quickly figure out what code was responsible for a given message.

</p><h2>Execution tracing</h2>

<p>As you&rsquo;re developing and testing your code, you might want to understand the flow of execution your code takes. You can add <code>trace()</code> calls to various points in your code:

</p><pre>
Log.debug?.trace()
</pre>

<p>The code above would print out the file and line number containing the <code>trace()</code> call, as well as the name of the calling function. The output looks like:

</p><pre>
ModularTable.swift:364 â€” tableView(_:cellForRowAtIndexPath:)
</pre>

<h2>Logging arbitrary values</h2>

<p>Sometimes life hands you an <code>NSError</code>. Why bother constructing a <i>new</i> message? The <code>NSError</code> <i>is</i> the message:

</p><pre>
Log.error?.value(err)
</pre>

<p>This function accepts <code>Any?</code>, meaning it&rsquo;ll handle anything you throw at it.

</p><h2>Extensibility

</h2><p>CleanroomLogger&rsquo;s extension points allow you to fully customize all aspects of logging without having to worry about the <i>mechanics</i> of how a logging engine is implemented.

</p><p>The ability to provide one or more custom <code>LogRecorder</code> implementations is particularly powerful. You could implement your own <code>LogRecorder</code> to do things like:

</p><ul><li>Write messages to a file or set of (potentially rotating) files
</li><li>Store messages with a <i>warning</i> or <i>error</i> severity in a database for subsequent diagnostic evaluation
</li><li>Send messages with an <i>error</i> severity to a network endpoint to enable rapid response to codebase instability
</li></ul><p>And because more than one <code>LogRecorder</code> can be used at a time, you can multiplex your log messages to multiple destinations without writing any additional code.
