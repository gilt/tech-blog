<p>We&rsquo;re excited to welcome the Full-Stack Engineering meetup <a href="http://tech.gilt.com/2013/12/19/a-full-stack-and-a-full-house" target="_blank">back to Gilt</a> on Tuesday, Jan. 28! (<a href="http://www.meetup.com/Full-Stack-Engineering-Meetup/events/152218942/" target="_blank">Go here</a> to RSVP.) The night&rsquo;s three speakers include HUGE Principal Architect <strong>Isaiah Belle</strong>, NBCUniversal Manager of Enterprise Architecture <strong>Sam Boyer</strong>, and open source advocate/hero <strong>Rocky Bernstein</strong>. The meetup starts at 6:30 PM at our 2 Park Avenue office and will include discussion of the PHP frameworks Symfony2 and Drupal. Oh, and we&rsquo;ll also have some delicious sandwiches!</p>
<p>Once described as someone who &quot;<a href="http://www.meetup.com/LispNYC/events/47373722/" target="_blank">lives in relative obscurity</a>,&ldquo; Rocky Bernstein is the creator of the Pydb extended Python debugger, the ruby-debug BASH debugger, and many other software tools used daily by millions. He was kind enough to take some time out of his schedule to answer a few questions:</p>
<p><strong>Gilt: In this age of social media, you seem to prefer flying under the radar to self-promoting. Why?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rocky Bernstein:</strong> I&rsquo;d say that most of the folks who have used software that I&rsquo;ve written wouldn&rsquo;t recognize my somewhat unusual name. I have neither a Facebook nor a Twitter account. With social things, there is a quality/quantity trade-off. The few friends that I have are very important to me, and I would rather devote a lot of time and effort towards those, than less time and effort towards more people. With respect to the software, what&rsquo;s important to me is getting stuff done and problems solved.</p>
<p><strong>G: How do you come up with open source projects to tackle&ndash;what&rsquo;s your creative process?</strong></p>
<p><strong>RB:</strong> Invariably the projects find me, and not the other way around. Sometimes people come to me with a request for a feature or something, and I ask them to take a stab at the problem first. A common response is that they don&rsquo;t know anything about the field. Well, jumping in can be a good way to learn.</p>
<p>The decision to start the CD-reading project was unusual in that it was politically motivated. It came from dissatisfaction with the DCMA (Digital Millenium Copyright Act), which I feel is a little Draconian. I didn&rsquo;t know anything about CD-reading or physics or debuggers when I started those projects. I like to think that I&rsquo;ve helped a lot of people learn new fields by encouraging them to just jump in and get started.</p>
<p><strong> <strong>G: H</strong>ow do you prioritize what to work on?</strong></p>
<p><strong>RB:</strong> In getting things done day to day, I often encounter annoyances, things that need to be addressed, and things that should be automated. I often have to deal with these by hand in order to get a task done, but later, I&rsquo;ll think about which things bothered me the most and ask how I can start to address them. I monitor statistics on my projects. For example, anyone who has a <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub</a>, <a href="http://sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">SourceForge</a>, or <a href="http://code.google.com/" target="_blank">code.google.com</a> account can star any number of other projects hosted on that organization. It costs nothing to flag a project.</p>
<p>When I&rsquo;m looking for something to work on, I&rsquo;ll look at the analytics for the various projects, and I will tend to work more on those with the most interest. The other kind of place I look at would be the download statistics that you can get from various package repositories: <a href="http://rubygems.org" target="_blank">RubyGems</a>, <a href="http://qa.debian.org/popcon.php" target="_blank">Debian QA</a>, <a href="http://pypi-ranking.info/alltime" target="_blank">PyPi Ranking</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What was your first open source project? And how many projects have you pursued in total?</strong></p>
<p><strong>RB:</strong> I started sharing code before the term &quot;open source&rdquo; was coined. In the old days, what you would do to let people know about your code was to write some an article about it for a magazine like <em>Byte</em> or <em>Dr. Dobb&rsquo;s Journal</em>. These magazines would have a place where you could download software mentioned in the articles. For some physics simulations I wrote with Greg Chatin at IBM Research. I arranged that, if people sent me a floppy disk and return postage, I&rsquo;d copy the programs onto that. Distribution by this method was very limited. A big breakthrough in distribution came from places like SourceForge, where they would host software that could be downloaded. </p>
<p><a href="https://masterbranch.com/rocky.bernstein#open-source-experience" target="_blank">This page</a> lists about 40 different open-source projects of mine. Not all of the projects are equal in size or weight, and some I am just a contributor on.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What do you think are the most important developments in the open-source community?<br/></strong></p>
<p>I mentioned public project repositories like SourceForge and GitHub, which make it easy to share code. At about the same time, maybe a little earlier, we started getting repositories for the various languages. Perl&rsquo;s CPAN was one of the oldest, and that clearly had a big impact on the language.</p>
<p>A feature of the early days was that you generally had to get someone&rsquo;s approval to share (or a magazine editor&rsquo;s decision that your software article was newsworthy). In order to get a CPAN account, for example, you needed to request an account, maybe list a project you were working on, and wait for someone to decide. The same is still true for GNU packages and Debian packages. This isn&rsquo;t necessarily wrong, but it limits the number of contributors.</p>
<p>Nowadays anyone can get an account on GitHub, SourceForge, or code.google.com. The process doesn&rsquo;t initially require someone&rsquo;s approval. But there have been many, many other improvements along the way; I have delighted in all of them:</p>
<ul><li>The various testing frameworks</li>
<li>Wikis on projects &ndash; anyone can write/improve documentation</li>
<li>Simple issue trackers</li>
<li>Public continuous integration systems like travis.org or drone.io with build status on the project page</li>
<li>irc, jabber, group jabber (e.g. Campfire)</li>
<li>Maybe code-review systems like <a href="http://code.google.com/p/rietveld/" target="_blank">Rietveld</a>, although I think the jury is still out on those.</li>
</ul><p><strong>G: What do you think are the biggest challenges in successfully launching a project that will gain widespread adoption?</strong></p>
<p><strong>RB:</strong> For me, having a project hit the big time feels like hitting the lottery. For example, this Ruby debugger I had been working on hit the big time because someone in the Ruby on Rails project decided to add it as a configuration option. Neither of us working on the debugger were alerted to this possibility beforehand.</p>
<p>So what I do, and recommend doing, is just to focus on things you think important, and focus on the work. If you are lucky, something might happen.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What are your favorite technologies right now?</strong></p>
<p><strong>RB:</strong> I&rsquo;m language-agnostic. In general, I prefer the dynamic languages (Ruby, Python, Lisp, Perl, POSIX Shell) over static ones (C++, C, Java), but recently I&rsquo;ve been working with Go, a static language, and I&rsquo;ll probably mention something there [at Tuesday&rsquo;s meetup].</p>
<p>I use GNU Emacs extensively and have for over 25 years. Initially I was impressed with its on-line help, and undo/redo. But most important from the beginning was the fact that it is completely programmable in a real programming language: Lisp. When I first looked at how Ruby was implemented in C, I found a remarkable similarity with how Emacs was implemented in C. The core Emacs functions are written in Lisp-like C, while Ruby is written in Ruby-like C. In both cases, they both do a lot with very little through the magic of orthogonality. I am impressed with how GNU Emacs, as old as it is, has evolved and adapted over the years.</p>
<p>Finally, having gone through four or so version control systems (SCCS, RCS, CVS, subversion) I&rsquo;m really happy with Git.</p>
<p><strong>Gilt: How did you find the Full-Stack Engineering meetup group?</strong></p>
<p><strong>RB: </strong>NYC is full of diversity. Although I still feel like a visitor, and am constantly learning new things about NYC, I&rsquo;ve lived here for about 35 years. I really like the idea of Full-Stack Engineering. I joined the group because I want to hear what others have to offer, and so far things have been really great.</p>
<p><strong>Gilt: What do you hope to cover in your talk on Tuesday?</strong></p>
<p><strong>RB:</strong> I&rsquo;m going to try to keep things short, even though I feel passionate about the full-stack development process. There will just be a few things here and there where perhaps I can point out something that folks haven&rsquo;t heard of, or mention a project I&rsquo;m working on. I&rsquo;ll probably also suggest a project that I think should be worked on.</p>
<p><em>Thanks, Rocky!</em></p>
