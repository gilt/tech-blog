<p>Check out Ryan Caloras, one of the Gilt Personalization Team&rsquo;s dedicated software engineers (and a former Boston resident), manning our swag station at last week&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.meetup.com/boston-scala/" target="_blank">Boston Area Scala Enthusiasts</a> meetup! Ryan&rsquo;s team mate, Lead Software Engineer (and fellow ex-Bostonian) Yoni Goldberg, was the night&rsquo;s featured speaker, and educated the crowd of 80-100 attendees about Gilt&rsquo;s shift from a monolithic Rails app to a distributed micro-services architecture written in Scala. By the end of the night, almost all of our swag was gone.</p>
<p>Thanks to BASE and everyone who came out for a memorable night!</p>
