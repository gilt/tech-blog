<p><a href="http://basho.com/" target="_blank">Basho</a> has just published video from its recent <a href="http://ricon.io/archive/2013/east.html" target="_blank">RICON East 2013</a> conference in NYC—including this video from my talk, <em>Scaling Happiness Horizontally</em>. In my presentation, I discuss Gilt’s approach to scaling our distributed organization and spend a fair bit of time discussing the contents of our <a href="http://tech.gilt.com/2013/03/07/scaling-agile-at-gilt-with-teams-ingredients" target="_blank"><em>Scaling Agile at Gilt</em></a> blog post—specifically, our methods of modeling our application architecture to influence team communication structures. There are a lot of similarities between scaling distributed computing systems and scaling organizations. (Gilt Tech is a distributed, peer-to-peer network.)</p>
