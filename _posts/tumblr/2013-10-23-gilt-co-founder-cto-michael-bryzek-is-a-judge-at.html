For the Pitch, MIT students and researchers have 60 seconds to deliver their business proposals to a panel of judges, who then offer instant feedback. Michael (an MIT alum) and the other panelists will judge contestants based on the viability of their business plans and their pitch presentations. Good luck to all the participants!<br/></span></span></p>
