<p>Gilt Principal Software Engineer <a href="http://tech.gilt.com/search/gregor+heine" target="_blank">Gregor Heine</a> added a frothy finishing touch to last week&rsquo;s <a href="http://tech.gilt.com/search/5%404" target="_blank">5@4</a> in Dublin by brewing up a batch of his homemade ale for the team. Gregor gave a brief &ldquo;Intro to Homebrewing&rdquo; course (to be cont&rsquo;d in future 5@4s) and included a live demo as part of his instruction. Now the Dublin team has to wait two weeks to sample his work!</p>
