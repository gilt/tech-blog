<p>For our first <a href="http://tech.gilt.com/search/dublin+scala+users+group" target="_blank">Dublin Scala Users Group</a> meetup of 2015, we&rsquo;ll have two great technical talks, hot pizza, cold beverages, and, as always, our comfy-n-colorful beanbags (<a href="http://tech.gilt.com/2014/09/24/slideshows-and-photos-from-last-nights-dublin" target="_blank">go here</a> to view them). Our speakers for the night:</p>
<ul><li>Gilt Principal Software Engineer Ugo Matrangolo will discuss the implementation of the Dependency Injection pattern in Scala, and will try to offer an honest (although opinionated) view of what works and what doesnâ€™t with Cake. He will also introduce ScalDI: a new framework that is rapidly gaining popularity among people who want a quick and easy DI implementation without using the Cake pattern.</li>
<li>Julien Sirocchi of Workday will talk about type classes, and will show how Scala programmers don&rsquo;t need to understand them to use them</li>
</ul><p>The SUG will meet up on Thursday, Feb. 5 at Gilt&rsquo;s office in Dublin 4; <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Dublin-Scala-users-group/events/220097522/" target="_blank"><strong>go here to RSVP</strong></a>.</p>
