<p>As fans and users of <a href="http://tech.gilt.com/2012/07/27/search-on-gilt" target="_blank">Apache Lucene/Solr</a>, we&rsquo;re excited to host the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/NYC-Apache-Lucene-Solr-Meetup/" title="NYC Apache Lucene/Solr Meetup - New York, NY" target="_blank"><span>NYC Apache Lucene/Solr Meetup</span></a>&rsquo;s roundtable this Wednesday, Feb. 12. Titled &ldquo;<a href="http://www.meetup.com/NYC-Apache-Lucene-Solr-Meetup/events/152814172/" target="_blank">Lucene/Solr: The Default Search Engine for Hadoop</a>,&rdquo; the meetup will feature some of the biggest Hadoop vendors in the market discussing ways to access data in a quick and predictable way that also leverages many of the features users have come to expect from search.
