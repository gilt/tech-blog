<p class="p1">Twenty years ago I used to teach object-oriented programming (based on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eiffel_(programming_language)" target="_blank"><span class="s1">Eiffel</span></a>) at <a href="https://www.fbi.h-da.de/willkommen-beim-fachbereich-informatik.html" target="_blank"><span class="s1">my old university</span></a> in Germany.</p>
<p class="p2">This week I got the chance to experience a deja-vu, because earlier this year I did run into <a href="http://www.cs.tcd.ie/Glenn.Strong/" target="_blank"><span class="s1">Glenn Strong</span></a> who is teaching <a href="https://www.scss.tcd.ie/disciplines/software_systems/fmg/fmg_web/courses/CS3016/" target="_blank"><span class="s1">Functional Programming in TCD in Dublin</span></a> and we started to develop the idea that it would be useful to add a <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/" target="_blank"><span class="s1">Scala</span></a> module to his <a href="http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Haskell" target="_blank"><span class="s1">Haskell</span></a> based lecture.</p>
<p class="p1">The main idea was that the module could complement the lecture by exposing the students to a second functional programming language and at the same time <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/tritsch.org/presentation/d/18jMvXmy3M9URVe0B-rlGxZ_rdnzV7OXKMfNDuu9rM6Q/edit#slide=id.p" target="_blank"><span class="s1">highlight</span></a> why at the current point in time Scala is the programming language of choice when large corporations decide to adopt a more functional programming paradigm (<a href="http://www.gilt.com/" target="_blank"><span class="s1">Gilt</span></a> being one of them).</p>
<p class="p1">In that context the module focused mainly on how well Scala co-exists with Java. The two real-world scenarios that got implemented in the lab exercises was to rewrite a piece of Java in Scala and to integrate Scala with existing Java source code. Feel free to <a href="https://github.com/rolandtritsch/scala-tcd-funcprog" target="_blank"><span class="s1">clone the repo</span></a> and play with it yourself. My stuff is in the roland.tritsch folder.</p>
