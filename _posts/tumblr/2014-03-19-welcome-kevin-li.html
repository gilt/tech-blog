<p>We&rsquo;re excited to welcome Software Engineer Kevin Li to Gilt&rsquo;s growing team of technologists! Kevin joins our Loyalty team, which works on our <a href="http://tech.gilt.com/2013/12/18/gilt-insider-the-5th-best-retail-loyalty-program-of" target="_blank">acclaimed</a> Gilt Insider program and related initiatives. Kevin joined us on Monday and has already made a bug fix and had a production deployment!</p>
<p>Originally from King of Prussia, Pa., Kevin has spent the past two years living in Norwalk, Conn. and working at a financial software company. Before that, he was a student at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. When he&rsquo;s not coding, you can find him snowboarding, working on personal embedded projects/hardware, or just hanging out with his friends. &ldquo;If you ask me to go to a happy hour or try out a new restaurant, I&rsquo;m always down,&rdquo; he says.</p>
