<p>Gilt is excited to participate in the <em>New York Times&rsquo;</em> <a href="http://opensourcesciencefair.com/" target="_blank">Open Source Science Fair 2.0</a>, taking place Thu 7/25 (starting time 6:15 PM) at the <em>Times</em>&rsquo; office building in Manhattan. In addition to highlighting our <a href="http://gilt.github.io/" target="_blank">open source</a> work, our exhibit (one of those old-school, cardboard trifold thingies) will promote the <a href="http://playframework.com/" target="_blank">Play Framework</a> and discuss our <a href="http://tech.gilt.com/2013/07/16/talking-to-typesafe-about-scala-akka-play-and-the" target="_blank">use of Play at Gilt</a>. Stop by our booth to say hello and to pick up some fashionable Scala, Play and Akka stickers and buttons (thanks to <a href="http://typesafe.com/" target="_blank">Typesafe</a> for their generosity!). We&rsquo;ll also answer any questions you might have about the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Play-NYC/" target="_blank">Play NYC</a> and <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Scala-Hacker-Hours/" target="_blank">Scala Hacker Hours NYC</a> meetups.</p>
