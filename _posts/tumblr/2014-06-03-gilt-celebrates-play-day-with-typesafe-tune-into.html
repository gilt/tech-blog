<p>Today <a href="http://typesafe.com/" target="_blank">Typesafe</a> celebrates its first-annual <a href="http://typesafe.com/blog/play-all-day-webinar-series" target="_blank">Play Day</a> with a full day of webinars&ndash;and #gilttech is honored to be a part of the activities! The sessions kick off at 9 AM PST with Adam Evans, Technical Lead for BBC Children&rsquo;s Future Media, &ldquo;Making The Case For Play,&rdquo; and run through 5:45 PM PST with Typesafe Lead Developer James Roper on &ldquo;Reactive Streams and Play 3.0.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Play Day module we&rsquo;re most excited about (we&rsquo;re a little biased :) ) comes at 2 PM PST, when Gilt Senior Software Engineer Giancarlo Silvestrin (Personalization Team) shares &ldquo;Lessons Learned From Implementing Play Across Lots of Small Applications and Microservices.&rdquo; Details on Giancarlo&rsquo;s presentation:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>This session will focus on Gilt&rsquo;s implementation of Play Framework across its architecture&ndash;starting with Gilt Live, a real-time page showcasing purchases made in real-time, and eventually branching out to many critical parts of the company&rsquo;s tech organization (from search to inventory status updates). Play has offered Gilt numerous advantages in terms of accessibility, scalability and performance. You&rsquo;ll hear more about lessons learned and the many advantages Play has offered to Gilt, a rapidly-moving eCommerce company with more than eight million users.</div>
</blockquote>
