<p>Payment Card Industry<br/>A poem by Sam Kassoumeh</p>
<p>PCI, oh PCI,<br/> 200 requirements we must comply.<br/><br/> From password settings to policies,<br/> The time has come to rotate the keys.<br/><br/> Above and beyond the norm we go.<br/> Protect the cards that is our goal.<br/><br/> Standing out in the ecommerce crowd,<br/> We take the steps to make our QSA proud.<br/><br/> Passphrase A and passphrase B,<br/> Will be joined in digital matrimony.<br/><br/> Fraudsters and hackers free or in the joint,<br/> You can&rsquo;t see our cards so sorry to disappoint.<br/><br/> And to the members we love so much,<br/> Your information cannot be touched.<br/><br/> Your credit cards can&rsquo;t be divulged,<br/> In gilt.com you may indulge.</p>
