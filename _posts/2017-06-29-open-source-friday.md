From the 54 public repos maintained at [code.gilt.com](http://code.gilt.com/) to the name of our tech blog (displayed in this tab's header), open source has been part of our team's DNA for years. Check out this [blog post](http://tech.gilt.com/front-end/2015/04/08/ubar-open-source-first-front-end-effort) from 2015 if you're not convinced.

Our open source love is why we're excited to participate in our first Open Source Friday on June 30. [Open Source Friday](https://opensourcefriday.com/) is an effort being led by GitHub to make it easier to contribute to the open source community. This [blog post](https://github.com/blog/2386-contribute-on-open-source-friday) has more detail on the who, what and why. We're hoping to make this a regular activity to help our teams foster an open-source-first culture as we grow and evolve. 

Some of the projects we'll be working on:

* [CleanroomLogger](https://github.com/emaloney/CleanroomLogger) - Evan Maloney will be tackling a specific long-standing user request: custom "named subsystems" for logging. Some background here: https://github.com/emaloney/CleanroomLogger/issues/37. 
* [ApiBuilder](https://www.apibuilder.io/) - Ryan Martin will be working on fixing some edge cases in the [Swagger Generator](https://github.com/apicollective/apibuilder-swagger-generator) for ApiBuilder.
*  [gfc-guava](https://github.com/gilt/gfc-guava) - Sean Sullivan will be updating the documentation for gfc-guava and working on compatability with [Google Guava 22.0](https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/Release22). 

If you're inspired but don't know where to start, head to our directory of [open source projects](http://code.gilt.com), visit [this list](http://up-for-grabs.net/) by GitHub or ping us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/hbcdigital) and we can help point you in the right direction.
