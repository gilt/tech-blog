# The New Gilt HQ 

Woohoo! Gilt and our colleagues at HBC Digital just moved into brand new offices! Our new digs are in Brookfield Place, a complex of office buildings across West Street from the Freedom Tower in Lower Manhattan. There's a lot to love about the new space.

## The office

It is great to have all of our NYC-based HBC and Gilt people in one location (we have teams in Dublin, St. Louis and Jackson and some remote engineers, too). We're confident working side-by-side will allow us to better integrate our teams and better leverage our strengths.

Everyone is also really stoked about the views. The floorplan was designed to maximize the views and natural light by keeping the workstations and common areas on the perimeter while offices and conference rooms are in the center of the floor. Our location on the water provides great (I mean _really_ great) views of the Statue of Liberty, New York Harbor, the Hudson River, Lower Manhattan and New Jersey.

The floor has dozens of conference rooms, a pantry, two large collaboration spaces and room for about 320 employees. Our ping pong and foosball tables will be arriving shortly. 

The design of the space is clean and minimalist with lots of white and grey touches. Everyone is loving their new super comfy Herman Miller Aeron chairs and the cool little sofas in the collaboration spaces. We have some nice portraits on the walls already and our creative teams are working on a mural for one of the bigger walls to give the floor some more character.

## The neighborhood 

Brookfield Place is an awesome place to work. We're right on the water and there is a marina with a sailing school and a handful of yachts right outside our doors. Our building is surrounded by grassy parks with volleyball courts, basketball courts and a skatepark in walking distance. The waterfront is car-free which gives the area a quiet and peaceful vibe. 

When it comes to food, the variety is amazing. In our building alone we have the huge French marketplace Le District and Hudson Eats, a food hall with a bunch of NYC hot spots like Chop't, Mighty Quinn's, Num Pang, Umami Burger, Dos Toros and Blue Ribbon to name a few. Around the neighborhood, we have Shack Shack, Parm, a bunch of great coffee shops, multiple Starbucks (of course) and Eataly, which just opened across the street. 

Other area amenities include an Equinox gym, tons of shopping, waterfront bars, Citibike stations, bike parking in our building and a ton of transit options. 

## The welcome

Of course, a new office needs to get broken in and People Operations was on it. We had breakfasts, lunch, a champagne toast and a watermelon social to help keep the excitement level high and give everyone a chance to meet their new neighbors since this was the first time our Gilt and HBC teams would be fully integrated on the same floor. The events were a hit and everyone seems be settling in nicely. Mission accomplished.
