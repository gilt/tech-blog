Held each year in June, QCon New York is one of the world's leading software development conferences. This year, we had speakers from HBC Digital present how our teams work and how we have leveraged containers. 

## What we've learned about building great teams and improving team communication

Heather Fleming, our VP, People Operations & Product Delivery PMO, delivered a talk on two frameworks that can be used to improve communication, increase empathy and establish the psychologically safe environment a team needs to thrive. She also demonstrates how we build teams around initiatives using a “Team Ingredients” framework that focuses on each individual's strengths and talents and what they contribute to the team.

## What we've learned from using container technology at HBC Digital

Our SVP, Engineering Adrian Trenaman's talk provides detailed examples of how HBC Digital has used Docker and where container technology has paid off and, pragmatically, what aspects of the technology haven't panned out as they thought they would.
